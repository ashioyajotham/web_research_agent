Task: They are not a subsidiary of another company, except if the parent company is a holding company
Result: **Key Findings:**

* A holding company (parent company) is an umbrella company that owns and controls multiple subsidiaries.
* Subsidiaries are separate entities with their own financial statements.
* A parent company exercises control over a subsidiary by owning 50% of its voting power, controlling its board, or owning 50% of its share capital.

**Related Information:**

* In the US, parent companies with over 80% control over subsidiaries receive tax benefits, including consolidated tax returns and tax-free dividend income.
* Parent companies provide advantages to subsidiaries, such as funding, expertise, and reduced production costs.
* Parent companies can structure relationships with subsidiaries in various ways, including conglomerates (diverse subsidiaries), horizontal integration (similar industries), and vertical integration (supply chain stages).
* Holding companies are similar to parent companies but do not engage in business operations themselves, solely focusing on controlling other companies.

**Contradiction Resolution:**

The article states that holding companies do not engage in business operations, while another source suggests that they may have some involvement. This contradiction can be resolved by clarifying that holding companies typically do not produce or provide their own goods or services but may still have some limited business activities, such as managing investments or providing administrative support to subsidiaries.
