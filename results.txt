* The data provided by Statista is for the top 100 companies globally, so it is possible that there are other companies outside of this list that earned more than €1B in revenue in 2023.

### Methodology

This synthesis was created by analyzing the provided research data and identifying relevant information.

### Sources

**Quality Indicators**

* **Good:** Statista is a reputable source for statistical data.

Task: They are not a subsidiary of another company, except if the parent company is a holding company
Result: ## Parent and Holding Company Relationship

### Definition of Parent Company

A parent company is a company that has a controlling interest in another company, giving it control of its operations. [1] A parent company can own 50% or more of the voting shares in another business, granting it the power to oversee and direct its operations. [4]

### Definition of Holding Company

A holding company is a type of parent company that owns and controls other companies but does not produce any goods or services or conduct business operations itself. [1, 4]

### Relationship Between Parent and Holding Companies

The terms "parent company" and "holding company" are often used interchangeably. [2] However, there is a subtle difference between the two. A holding company is a specific type of parent company that does not engage in any operations other than owning and managing its subsidiaries. [3, 5]

### Methodology

The conclusions in this report were reached by synthesizing the results of two separate Google searches. The first search was conducted to determine if a company has a parent company. The second search was conducted to determine if the parent company is a holding company. The search results were analyzed to identify the most relevant and reliable information.
