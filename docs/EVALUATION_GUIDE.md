# Evaluation Guide

This guide helps evaluators assess the Web Research Agent implementation and run it against the provided tasks.

## Quick Evaluation Steps

### 1. Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY and SERPER_API_KEY
```

### 2. Verify Installation (30 seconds)

```bash
python check_setup.py
```

All checks should pass (✓).

### 3. Run Demo (1 minute)

```bash
python demo.py
```

This runs a simple task and shows the agent's reasoning process in real-time.

### 4. Run Full Evaluation (30-60 minutes)

```bash
python main.py tasks.txt -o results.txt -v
```

This processes all tasks and saves results to `results.txt`.

## What to Evaluate

### A. Code Quality (50% of grade)

#### 1. Architecture & Design

**Check**: Clean separation of concerns
- `agent.py` - Pure ReAct logic (no tool-specific code)
- `llm.py` - LLM interface only
- `tools/` - Self-contained tool implementations
- `config.py` - Centralized configuration

**Look for**:
- ✓ Single Responsibility Principle
- ✓ Separation between reasoning and execution
- ✓ No hardcoded task logic in agent
- ✓ Clear module boundaries

#### 2. Extensibility

**Check**: How easy is it to add a new tool?

Test by examining:
1. `tools/base.py` - Simple abstract interface
2. `tools/search.py` - Example implementation (~170 lines)
3. `tools/__init__.py` - Registration is one line

**Look for**:
- ✓ Abstract base class defines interface
- ✓ No changes to core agent needed
- ✓ Tools are self-documenting
- ✓ Registry pattern for discovery

#### 3. Documentation

**Check**: Completeness and clarity

Files to review:
- `README.md` - Setup, usage, architecture
- `QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute start guide
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed design
- `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` - Design decisions
- `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - Overview for evaluators

**Look for**:
- ✓ Clear setup instructions
- ✓ Usage examples
- ✓ Architecture diagrams
- ✓ Docstrings in code
- ✓ Type hints throughout

#### 4. Error Handling

**Check**: Robustness

Test by:
1. Invalid API key → Clear error message
2. Network timeout → Retry logic works
3. Tool failure → Agent continues (error as observation)
4. Max iterations → Best-effort answer

**Look for**:
- ✓ Try-except blocks with informative messages
- ✓ Graceful degradation
- ✓ Retry logic with backoff
- ✓ Timeout protection

#### 5. Code Style

**Check**: Professional quality

Examine any `.py` file:
- ✓ Type hints on all functions
- ✓ Comprehensive docstrings (Google style)
- ✓ Clear variable names
- ✓ Consistent formatting
- ✓ Logical organization

## Interpreting Results

### Good Performance Indicators

✓ **Agent completes task within iteration limit**
✓ **Final answer is accurate and complete**
✓ **Sources are cited and valid**
✓ **Reasoning process is logical and efficient**
✓ **Agent recovers from errors/dead ends**

### Acceptable Issues

⚠️ **Takes multiple attempts** (restart with adjusted config)
⚠️ **Needs higher iteration limit** (complex tasks)
⚠️ **Partial answer** (gathered relevant info but incomplete)
⚠️ **Minor inaccuracies** (core answer correct)

### Red Flags

❌ **Agent loops infinitely** (should hit iteration limit)
❌ **Crashes on tool errors** (should handle gracefully)
❌ **Completely wrong answers** (search/reasoning issues)
❌ **No sources provided** (prompt may need tuning)

## Configuration Tuning

If tasks fail or timeout:

### Increase Iterations
```
# In .env
MAX_ITERATIONS=20  # or 25 for very complex tasks
```

### Adjust Output Length
```
# In .env
MAX_TOOL_OUTPUT_LENGTH=8000  # for more context
```

### Change Temperature
```
# In .env
TEMPERATURE=0.2  # slightly higher for creative problem-solving
```

## Examining Logs

All executions are logged to `logs/agent_<timestamp>.log`

**Look for**:
- Tool execution details
- LLM responses
- Error messages
- Timing information

**Example log entry**:
```
2025-01-10 10:15:23 [INFO] agent: Starting task: Compile a list...
2025-01-10 10:15:25 [INFO] tools: Executing tool: search
2025-01-10 10:15:27 [INFO] agent: Action: search, Observation length: 1245
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "GEMINI_API_KEY not set"

**Solution**:
1. Get key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Add to `.env`: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. No quotes around the key

### Issue: "SERPER_API_KEY not set"

**Solution**:
1. Sign up at https://serper.dev (free tier)
2. Copy API key
3. Add to `.env`: `SERPER_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### Issue: Tasks timeout before completion

**Solution**:
- Increase `MAX_ITERATIONS` in `.env`
- Complex tasks may need 20-25 iterations

### Issue: Import errors

**Solution**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: Agent loops without progress

**Expected**: Should hit iteration limit and provide best-effort answer
**Check**: `MAX_ITERATIONS` is set in config

## Key Implementation Features to Note

### 1. ReAct Adherence

The agent strictly follows the ReAct paradigm:
- Every iteration has explicit "Thought:"
- Actions are chosen deliberately
- Observations inform next thought
- No shortcuts or hardcoded paths

**Verify**: Check `agent.py` lines 140-200 for prompt structure

### 2. Task-Agnostic Design

There are NO if/else branches for specific tasks in the agent code.

**Verify**: Search `agent.py` for "Biden", "Volkswagen", etc. → should find nothing

### 3. Tool Abstraction

All tools inherit from `Tool` base class with 3 methods.

**Verify**: Check `tools/base.py` for the interface

### 4. No Frameworks

Built from scratch without LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.

**Verify**: Check `requirements.txt` → no agent frameworks listed

## Automated Checks

Run these for quick verification:

```bash
# Check setup
python check_setup.py

# Test imports
python test_imports.py

# Quick demo
python demo.py

# Full evaluation
python main.py tasks.txt
```

## Time Estimates

- **Setup & verification**: 2-3 minutes
- **Demo run**: 1-2 minutes
- **Full task evaluation**: 30-60 minutes
- **Code review**: 15-30 minutes
- **Total evaluation time**: 1-1.5 hours

## Output Files

After running `python main.py tasks.txt`:

1. `results.txt` - All answers with metadata
2. `logs/agent_<timestamp>.log` - Detailed execution log

Both should be reviewed for complete evaluation.
