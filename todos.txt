Let's think about this from a human cognitive perspective:

Task Understanding When a human sees that task about Biden's statements, they would:
Recognize it's a list compilation task
Note the key requirements (10 statements, separate occasions, sources needed)
Understand they need to synthesize information, not just collect snippets
Know they need to verify each statement is unique and properly sourced
Current Issues The current implementation has several problems:
It's treating every task the same way (just returning search snippets)
There's no real task comprehension
The planner's Tesla example is indeed rigid and not really helpful
The agent lacks the "synthesis" step that humans naturally do
Better Approach We should: a) First implement task comprehension:
b) For the Biden statements example:

Search for relevant sources
Extract actual quotes
Verify dates are different
Format into a clean list
Include proper citations
Planner Improvement The current planner with the Tesla example should be rethought to:
Be more generic and flexible
Focus on task patterns rather than specific examples
Include synthesis patterns like:
List compilation
Data extraction
Analysis
Comparison
Fact-finding
