### Features
- Task-agnostic design (no hardcoded logic for specific tasks)
- Maximum iteration limit to prevent infinite loops
- Best-effort answer generation when timeout occurs
- Context truncation to manage token limits
- Configurable temperature, model, and timeout settings
- Full execution trace for debugging
- Graceful error handling (errors become observations)
- Support for multi-line tasks in input files
- Verbose logging mode for detailed debugging
- Custom output file specification

### Technical Details
- Python 3.8+ compatibility
- Built from scratch without agent frameworks (no LangChain, etc.)
- Clean separation of concerns (agent, LLM, tools, config)
- Strategy pattern for tool implementations
- Registry pattern for tool management
- Abstract base class for tool interface
- Dependency injection for testability
- Environment-based configuration (12-factor app)
- Structured logging with multiple levels
- Exponential backoff for API retries
- Subprocess-based code execution (not eval)
- BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- html2text for content conversion
- Regex-based response parsing with fallback logic

### Documentation
- 7 comprehensive markdown documentation files
- ~3,000 lines of documentation
- Architecture diagrams and data flow illustrations
- Code examples and usage patterns
- Troubleshooting guides and common issues
- Configuration reference
- API key setup instructions
- Tool development guide
- Testing guidelines
