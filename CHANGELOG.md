- **Enhanced URL Handling**: `_get_search_result_url()`, `_is_valid_url()`, `_extract_all_urls_from_results()` with comprehensive fallback strategies
- **New Utility Methods**: `_format_source_verification()`, `_format_numerical_findings()`, `_extract_content_items()`, and multiple formatting utilities
- **Improved Core Logic**: Enhanced `_format_results()` now calls dynamic analysis and synthesis system instead of defaulting to entity extraction
