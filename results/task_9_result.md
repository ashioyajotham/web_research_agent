# Task: The total greenhouse gas emissions from their automotive operations are available for 2021, 2022, and 2023

# Research Results: The total greenhouse gas emissions from their automotive operations are available for 2021, 2022, and 2023

## Plan

1. **Search for publicly available greenhouse gas emission data from automotive operations for 2021, 2022, and 2023.** (using search)
2. **Review search results and identify potential sources of the required data (e.g., company sustainability reports, industry association data). Prioritize sources with a high degree of reliability and transparency.** (using browser)
3. **Extract the total greenhouse gas emissions for each year (2021, 2022, 2023) from the selected source(s).  If multiple sources are used, ensure consistency and reconcile any discrepancies.** (using browser)
4. **Organize the extracted data into a structured format suitable for presentation.** (using present)
