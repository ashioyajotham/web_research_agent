# Task: By what percentage did Volkswagen reduce the sum of their Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 compared to 2021?

# Research Results: By what percentage did Volkswagen reduce the sum of their Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 compared to 2021?

## Plan

1. **Search for Volkswagen's 2023 Sustainability Report** (using search)
2. **Fetch the first search result URL** (using search)
3. **Extract the main content of the Volkswagen 2023 Sustainability Report** (using browser)
4. **Extract Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data for 2023 from the report content** (using code)
5. **Search for Volkswagen's 2021 Sustainability Report or relevant emissions data** (using search)
6. **Fetch the first search result URL for 2021 data** (using search)
7. **Extract the main content of the relevant 2021 report or webpage** (using browser)
8. **Extract Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data for 2021** (using code)
9. **Calculate the percentage reduction** (using code)
10. **Return the calculated percentage reduction** (using code)
