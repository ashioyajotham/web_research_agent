MATERIAL IMPACTS AND RISKS AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH STRATEGY AND BUSINESS MODEL Impacts relating to climate change mitigation and energy The positive and negative impacts described below, relating to climate change mitigation and energy were assessed as material actual and potential impacts in the double materiality assessment. It is to be expected that both the positive and the negative impacts will continue over a long-term time horizon. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are generated along the Volkswagen Group value chain, primarily in the use phase of our products, and it contributes to climate change. GHG emissions are also caused through the mining and processing of raw materials, the manufacture of components in the supply chain, and the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own operations. Negative impacts also arise in this context through energy consumption along the value chain. A decisive factor is the continued significant reliance on fossil energy sources, the production and use of which are associated with GHG and other emissions. The focal points in this regard are also the use phase of the products, the production processes in the upstream value chain and the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own production processes. The Volkswagen Group also contributes to positive impacts on climate change mitigation and energy along the value chain by reducing GHG emissions and promoting the use of renewable energy. The greatest effects can be found in the downstream value chain in the use of the vehicles: The transition to e-mobility, which enables the widespread use of renewable energy in the transportation sector, serves to reduce primary energy requirements and GHG emissions compared to vehicles with internal combustion engines. The processes for identifying possible impacts as part of GHG accounting or energy management are described in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Metrics: Climate change \u00e2\u0080\u009d section regarding compiling the relevant metrics. Process description and results of the climate risk analysis Transition risks Possible transition risks and opportunities were identified using a scenario analysis and on the basis of additional in-house sources within the double materiality assessment (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Procedure for identifying material information \u00e2\u0080\u009d section of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeneral information\u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter for further information). The time horizons of the analysis correspond to the general definitions in this report. The connections between the service lives of the capital goods and the time horizons from strategic planning are set out in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Procedure for identifying material information \u00e2\u0080\u009d section of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeneral information\u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter. The scenario used in the scenario analysis was Net Zero by 2050 from the International Energy Agency (IEA). The main sources used were the IEA report \u00e2\u0080\u009cNet Zero Roadmap: A Global Pathway to Keep the 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C Goal in Reach \u00e2\u0088\u00922023 Update\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGlobal EV Outlook 2024\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The reports take into account the latest progress reports of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) at the time of preparation, and therefore the current state of climate science. The IEA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Global Energy and Climate Model on which it is based models not only the necessary transformation of the transportation sector, but also of additional sectors relevant for the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value chain and business model, such as energy and raw materials production. The ambition level of the scenario is aimed at the ideal goal of the Paris Climate Agreement of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C; the scenario provides for a limited overshoot of the 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C target, with a decline in the global temperature rise to around 1.4\u00c2\u00b0C by 2100. This makes it suitable for estimating a maximum expected intensity and speed of the transition events, and thus the maximum risk exposure. The Group also investigated processes with lower intensity and speed, particularly in the regulatory environment, as part of strategy development, to address uncertainties regarding the forms of risk driver (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Strategy: Climate change resilience \u00e2\u0080\u009d section for further information). This did not reveal any additional risks. The IEA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cNet Zero by 2050\u00e2\u0080\u009d scenario requires proactive alignment by automotive producers with stricter regulations, technological disruptions and the change in the energy mix. The focus on battery-electric vehicles, innovative business models and sustainable value chains is defined as crucial to ensure long-term competitiveness and satisfy the requirements for the net-zero targets. The scenario considers various time horizons. Specific statements relating to the transportation sector in particular are made for 2030, 2035 and 2050. The focus of the analysis was on development until 2030 for the medium-term time horizon and until 2035 for the long-term time horizon. Several relevant transition events were identified based on the scenario. The scenario is based on the assumption that governments around the world will be implementing ambitious climate policies, including carbon pricing, stricter fleet emission standards, and bans on new registrations of internal combustion engine vehicles in key markets. The expansion of incentive schemes to promote battery-electric vehicles is also anticipated. In terms of the market, the scenario assumes that increasing availability and decreasing costs will be additional factors in driving the demand for battery-electric vehicles \u00e2\u0080\u0093 provided that the charging infrastructure is expanded quickly. Based on these assumptions, the percentage of battery-electric vehicles among passenger cars sold worldwide will increase to 67% by 2030, and among heavy trucks to 37%. However, this development may vary widely between regions. It would cause increased demand for battery raw materials, and sustainably produced and recycled materials in the medium to long term, which may result in limited availability and price increases. From a technological perspective, the scenario assumes that current battery technology will continue to develop and that energy efficiency will significantly improve across all sectors. This could reduce emissions from the upstream value chain considerably. The transition events were located along the value chain and were analyzed qualitatively in terms of impacts on strategy and business model in the form of potential risks and opportunities. These were compared with the risks and opportunities formulated in the double materiality assessment. The evaluation was performed in the double materiality assessment by the relevant departments in consultation with Group risk management and sustainability management (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Procedure for and results of the double materiality assessment \u00e2\u0080\u009d section of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeneral information\u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter). The risk of failing to meet the statutory worldwide fleet emission targets, for example, due to insufficient transition to electric drivetrains or lack of market resonance \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was defined as material for the company. Financial effects would result primarily from the charges payable in such case. In this context, an amount in the mid-three-digit-million euro range was added to provisions in the reporting year. Financial effects are also expected to be associated with this risk in 2025. This risk was classed as material for all time horizons. Material risks resulting from the need for sustainable raw materials are described in the chapter \u00e2\u0080\u009c Resource use and circular economy \u00e2\u0080\u009d. Physical risks The assessment of climate-related risks for the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own sites involved examining climate-related hazards for the 200 most important sites. These included all production sites along with key sales, administration and development sites. The investigation was conducted with a software tool that uses the geo-coordinates of the sites. Both chronic hazards such as heat and cold stress, and acute physical hazards such as river floods and storm floods, were analyzed. The periods examined were based on those of the software tools employed and were largely in line with the periods used in this report. The short term corresponds to the status quo view in the tool. The medium term refers to development until 2030 and corresponds to the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategic planning period, including capital allocation planning. The long-term time horizon refers to development until 2050, to reflect the potential service lives of the assets. The IPCC Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP5-8.5) scenario was used for the forecast. This represents a high emission scenario based on the current state of climate science, and therefore plausibly reflects the maximum expected risk exposure in terms of severity and likelihood of occurrence. It predicts global warming of 3.3\u00c2\u00b0C to 5.7\u00c2\u00b0C by the end of the 21st century and is based on intensive use of fossil fuels, economic growth, and energy-intensive lifestyles. As regards our own operations, it was determined that some of the sites investigated are already exposed to relevant climate hazards, such as river flooding or storm surges. Additional stress factors (for example heat stress, cold stress, precipitation, etc.) were also investigated as part of the risk analysis. These risks are less relevant in terms of negative impacts on production activities. However, the risk of direct damage and a resulting production outage was deemed not material in the materiality assessment based on the expected financial implications at Group level over all time horizons considered. The upstream value chain is monitored and examined based on processes and data for both the short-term and the long-term. Based on current climate change predictions, the Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upstream value chain will also be more exposed to climate-related hazards in the future. Consequently, there may be supply disruptions and adjustments to production programs at the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production sites. This was identified as a material risk over all time horizons in the double materiality assessment. Interaction with strategy and business model The material impacts and risks identified with respect to climate change mitigation and energy have an effect on the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model and strategy. The topics of climate change mitigation and energy are key elements of the Group strategy relating to the decarbonization of the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business activities. Climate change mitigation is also an important aspect of the Group sustainability strategy regenerate+. A detailed strategic classification of material impacts and risks is provided in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Strategy: Climate change and transition plan \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. Information on the future adaptability of the strategy and business model with a view to material transition risks is provided in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Strategy: Climate change resilience \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. The material impacts and risks are addressed through policies, actions and targets at various levels. The focus is on mitigating negative impacts, reinforcing positive impacts, and avoiding or mitigating material risks. The policies and overarching actions regarding the material positive and negative impacts described in the areas of climate change mitigation and energy are presented in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Climate change mitigation and energy efficiency \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. The section on \u00e2\u0080\u009c Use of renewable energies \u00e2\u0080\u009d describes additional actions relating to the impacts from the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own operations and the upstream and downstream value chain, including the use phase of products. Further details and examples of implementation of the actions can be found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Actions and resources: Climate change \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. The actions set out in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c No decarbonization without e-mobility \u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009c Increasing vehicle efficiency \u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009c Net CO 2 e-neutral use phase \u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009c Contribution to climate-friendly logistics and hard-to-abate sectors \u00e2\u0080\u009d sections are aimed at the impacts in the use phase of the products. The actions set out in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Climate change mitigation in manufacturing \u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009c Zero Impact Logistics \u00e2\u0080\u009d, and \u00e2\u0080\u009c Decarbonization of the dealership networks \u00e2\u0080\u009d sections relate to impacts in own operations and sections of the downstream value chain. The actions relating to the upstream supply chain are presented in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Requirements for decarbonization in the supply chain \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. Policies and actions to manage material risks are presented in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Strategy: Climate change resilience \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. The target set out in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cReduction of Scope 3 GHG emissions in the use phase\u00e2\u0080\u009d section also contributes to the identified material transition risk. The same applies to the actions presented in the section \u00e2\u0080\u009c No decarbonization without e-mobility \u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009c Increasing vehicle efficiency \u00e2\u0080\u009d. STRATEGY: CLIMATE CHANGE AND TRANSITION PLAN Climate change strategy Sustainability will remain a significant topic in the business world and will continue to gain in importance, being driven by the increasingly apparent consequences of climate change, greater awareness of sustainable lifestyles among customers and not least conditions such as the Paris Climate Agreement. Decarbonization is a core component of Group activity and plays a key role in the Volkswagen Group strategy. Our decarbonization strategy applies to the entire Group. We do not yet have a Group-wide decarbonization plan within the meaning of ESRS E1 paragraph 16 is not yet in place, and the TRATON GROUP and MAN Energy Solutions do not have a transition plan. The TRATON GROUP and MAN Energy Solutions are developing independent transition plans, which are to be integrated in subsequent reporting cycles. The following actions and metrics on implementing the decarbonization program focus on the passenger cars and light commercial vehicles area of vehicle-related business. The transformation driven by digitalization and electrification requires extensive investment, which is incorporated in the Group strategy and included in medium-term planning. Operationalizing the decarbonization program Our decarbonization program for our passenger cars and light commercial vehicles business area covers the entire life cycle of our products. It is being put into operation via a clear hierarchy of actions, which is configured as follows for the passenger cars and light commercial vehicles business area: The top priority is to take action to avoid CO 2 e emissions. In second place are actions with which the Group aims to gradually shift the energy supply to renewable energy across the entire value chain and in all phases of a vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. Finally, unavoidable CO 2 e emissions are offset in selected cases through climate action projects that meet the highest international standards. Further information is provided in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. In the hierarchy of actions, the Volkswagen Group includes definitions of four decarbonization levers to be used to achieve the emission reduction targets: (1) e-mobility, (2) conversion of energy supply, (3) energy efficiency and (4) decarbonization in the value chain. The decarbonization levers are explained in more detail in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Actions and resources: Climate change \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. With respect to our production sites (Scope 1 and 2), we pursue the goal of reducing emissions by 90% in absolute terms between 2018 and 2040 and neutralizing the remaining emissions to achieve net CO 2 e neutrality at our production sites. We aim to reduce Scope 3 CO 2 e emissions in the use phase by 30% between 2018 and 2030. Specific actions for target achievement, such as climate change mitigation in manufacturing and no decarbonization without e-mobility are described in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Actions and resources: Climate change \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. Commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement and our climate targets We are committed to the Paris Climate Agreement and align our own activities with the 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C goal. It is our aim to be a net carbon-neutral company by 2050. We plan to achieve this through the hierarchy of actions described above, with clear priority placed on first reducing and avoiding emissions, and only applying offsetting actions for emissions that are difficult to avoid or completely unavoidable. We have set an intermediate goal for ourselves during our journey to net carbon neutrality: to reduce production-related CO 2 e emissions by 50.4% by 2030 compared with the base year 2018. The renowned Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) confirmed that our Group meets the requirements for contributing to limiting global warming to 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C with this objective for the production phase (Scope 1 and 2). The Volkswagen Group also aims to reduce CO 2 e emissions in passenger cars and light commercial vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use phase (Scope 3 category 11) by 30% by 2030 (compared with 2018). This target has also been independently certified by the SBTi as 2\u00c2\u00b0C aligned. Strategic implementation through Group-wide sustainability management A Group-wide sustainability management system that includes the issue of climate change mitigation has also been established in the Volkswagen Group. The related structures, processes and responsibilities are documented in an internal Group policy. The progress of the transition plan is measured through the strategic metrics, which include Scope 1 and 2 emissions and the proportion of battery-electric vehicles (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c GHG emissions \u00e2\u0080\u009d section as well as the \u00e2\u0080\u009c General information \u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter for further information). These also measure the progress of regenerate+. Activities with respect to the EU Taxonomy Detailed information on the EU Taxonomy is provided in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c EU Taxonomy \u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter. Production capacity and technical equipment Production capacity and technical equipment that focus on the manufacture of vehicles with internal combustion engines run the risk of losing value and potentially becoming \u00e2\u0080\u009cstranded assets\u00e2\u0080\u009d during the transition to a decarbonized business approach. The share of these investments is secondary compared to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (total) GHG emissions, as it is largely limited to the production of vehicles. The Group counters this risk by focusing its investment program on capacity that serves the transformation of the Group. Exposure to coal, and oil and gas-related activities The Volkswagen Group focuses on the manufacture, sale and marketing of motor vehicles and mobility solutions. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main area of economic activity is the manufacture of motor vehicles. The investments in this sector are the only ones classified as material. The analysis of economic activities revealed that activities involving coal, oil, and gas primarily take place in the context of vehicle-related business and are to be attributed to this. Disclosure on EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks The exclusion criteria for EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks were reviewed in the context of the Climate Benchmark Regulation, and it was determined that Annex 12.1 does not apply. EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks are indices subject to specific criteria and compiled by providers in line with such criteria in addition to their own. Nor are any exclusions by administrators of EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks pursuant to Annex 12.2 known. Responsibilities for sustainable implementation In-depth information on responsibilities is provided in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Sustainability management \u00e2\u0080\u009d section of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeneral information\u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter. STRATEGY: CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE The resilience analysis was performed in the reporting year and is based on the results of the climate risk analysis (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Process description and results of the climate risk analysis \u00e2\u0080\u009d section) and the materiality assessment (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Procedure for identifying material information \u00e2\u0080\u009d section of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeneral information\u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter). The critical assumptions made regarding the development of the sector derived from the scenario analysis are also included. The analysis covers the key elements of the business model and focuses on impacts, risks and opportunities identified as material and their main drivers along the value chain. Several aspects were included in the assessment of the Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resilience: operational control mechanisms with regard to the material impacts, risks and opportunities, their inclusion in corporate planning and strategy, as well as the capacities required for a more far-reaching alignment of the business model. The time periods correspond to those in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeneral information\u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Notes on use of the ESRS \u00e2\u0080\u009d section, like they were also used in the double materiality assessment. For the long-term time horizon, the focus is on developments up to 2035, the target year for the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future strategy. A key element in increasing resilience to climate change is the positioning of decarbonization as a cornerstone of the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategy, as explained above in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Strategy: Climate change and transition plan \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. In addition, climate change mitigation is firmly anchored in regenerate+ and is measured and managed using relevant metrics, including the decarbonization index (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Targets: Climate change \u00e2\u0080\u009d section). The Konzern-Steuerkreis Flotten-Compliance (KSK FC \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Group Steering Committee for Fleet Compliance) is responsible for managing greenhouse gas emissions relating to fleet emissions. It includes experts from all brands and relevant departments. The KSK FC monitors compliance with regulatory requirements and can initiate in particular short- and medium-term actions, for example for sales management, in the event of potential deviations. The regulatory requirements and forecasts are also factored into the medium- and long-term planning process. The key lever for complying with ambitious fleet limits is the further electrification of the product range (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Actions and resources: Climate change \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. The relevant targets are defined with the brands in the planning process, and capital expenditure requirements and necessary adaptations to the production sites are identified over a five-year time horizon. Uncertainties remain with regard to the speed and consistency at which electrification is being driven forward by regulatory actions in the various markets. As a result, a number of different scenarios will be examined during the development of the future Group strategy 2035. Specific courses of action were developed and evaluated on this basis, allowing the Group to adapt flexibly to different variations in the regulatory environment. In conclusion, the resilience analysis revealed that the material impacts and transition risks are addressed comprehensively, specifically and using an integrated approach. The operational control mechanisms presented and their explicit inclusion in the integrated planning primarily have an impact in the short term, while the adapted future Group strategy will have a medium- to long-term impact. The Group has sufficient capacity to implement the adjustment measures. In recent years, a double-digit number of sites has already been successfully converted to the production of battery-electric vehicles or the components required for them. This approach serves as a blueprint for the further transformation of the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sites. Implementation of the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emissions reduction strategy, in the context of the decarbonization strategy, requires extensive retraining and upskilling actions, some of which are already being implemented. A strategic approach is in place and regular discussions are held within the Volkswagen Group on training-related topics (see also the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Policies: Employees and non-employees \u00e2\u0080\u009d section in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmployees and non-employees\u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter). The Volkswagen Group has access to a range of money market and capital market instruments to cover its capital requirements for the further implementation of its decarbonization strategy (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Refinancing \u00e2\u0080\u009d section in the Group management report). The Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Green Finance Framework enables the company to refinance EU Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure, for example for developing and manufacturing all-electric vehicles, through sustainable financial instruments (see also the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Strategy: Climate change and transition plan \u00e2\u0080\u009d section). The Volkswagen Group has implemented processes and methodologies in supply chain management intended to effectively mitigate short-term supply disruptions. These include an established crisis management structure in Procurement and cross-departmental coordination between Procurement, Quality Assurance, Development, Production, and Logistics. In conjunction with a worldwide supplier network, this may help to compensate for the loss of individual supplier locations in many cases. In the medium to long term, resilience to the effects of climate-related hazards will be a key component of the procurement strategy. In conclusion, the resilience analysis revealed that the material impacts and transition risks are addressed comprehensively, specifically and using an integrated approach. The ability to adapt the business model to the challenges of climate change is therefore considered to be secured for the short, medium and long term. Due to the large number of Group sites, it has not yet been possible to conduct a comprehensive analysis of specific countermeasures at site level to assess physical climate risks. This has been done as part of the risk analysis for the EU Taxonomy for the relevant sites. More detailed information on this can be found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c EU Taxonomy \u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter. As a general rule, Business Continuity Management requires all operating units to carry out a risk assessment and, if necessary, to develop appropriate contingency plans. Furthermore, the Volkswagen Group continuously and regularly calls on its supply chain to make its own supply chain resilient to climate-related hazards. Furthermore, the Group has already examined specific exposure to climate hazards and the countermeasures taken at some sites. In the coming years, this will be systematically addressed at all production sites and monitored using milestone plans and checks on effectiveness. Another aspect of resilience is comprehensive coverage of the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own assets with corresponding insurance policies, which are regularly reviewed and adapted to changing risk situations in consultation with insurers for the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own sites. As a result, it can be assumed that the sites included in detail in the context of the EU Taxonomy are largely resilient to physical climate risks over the observed periods. In light of the existing overarching control mechanisms, the remaining sites and direct upstream value chain are assumed to be basically resilient. This resilience will be further strengthened in the medium term. With regard to climate-related hazards in the indirect or further upstream supply chain, there are still uncertainties in the short to medium term that will be addressed in the future across the entire automotive and supplier industry. POLICY: DECARBONIZATION Decarbonization is a key focal point for the Group and is supported by a corresponding policy. This is based on scientific principles and aims to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. That is why we derive our climate strategy from the requirements of the GHG Protocol and the SBTi, among other frameworks. We are committed to the Paris Climate Agreement and have defined corresponding climate change mitigation targets to help limit global warming to 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C. A detailed description of our commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement can be found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Strategy: Climate change and transition plan \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. Targets in this context are explained in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Targets: Climate change \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. The \u00e2\u0080\u009c Introduction to environmental management \u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter specifies the corresponding monitoring processes of the decarbonization policy. The double materiality assessment identified impacts and risks for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cClimate change\u00e2\u0080\u009d topical standard (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Material impacts and risks and their interaction with strategy and business model \u00e2\u0080\u009d section). The identified impacts and risks are analyzed using the risk management process described above and addressed with actions as part of the decarbonization policy. The Group strategy with a focus on decarbonization, regenerate+, the environmental mission statement goTOzero, and our Code of Conduct for Business Partners play a particularly important role in this. A detailed description of the relevant content can be found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Introduction to environmental management \u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter. In addition to other relevant topics, energy and CO 2 are focal points of the Zero Impact Factory strategic vision, under which the Volkswagen Group is pursuing goals including the gradual reduction of the absolute environmental impact of its production sites for passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and components, measured in impact points, by 2050. Moreover, the Volkswagen Group aims to ensure that its production sites meet at least 60% of the internally developed site checklist in 2030. Energy and CO 2 are two specific action areas here. Finally, in accordance with the Code of Conduct for Business Partners, reducing GHG emissions and using renewable energy sources are sustainability requirements in environmental protection for our business partners. Climate change mitigation and energy efficiency The topic of climate change mitigation is part of our Group sustainability strategy regenerate+ and one of the action areas of our environmental mission statement goTOzero. We systematically focus on the electrification of our products, decarbonization of our entire value chain and expansion of renewable energy generation to supply our sites and customers. We aim to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2050. A detailed description of the decarbonization levers and corresponding actions can be found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Actions and resources: Climate change \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. In line with our Group sustainability strategy regenerate+, we are focusing on increasing energy efficiency and transitioning to a renewable energy supply to allow us to decarbonize our production sites. Efficient use of energy in production enables cost savings and avoids environmental impacts while maintaining or increasing production performance. Reduced energy requirements have the potential to reduce the negative impacts associated with the provision of energy. A CO 2 e-free energy supply is not currently feasible for all aspects of global energy needs, so energy efficiency remains an important basis for effective climate change mitigation and should always be the first lever (a detailed explanation can be found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Conversion of energy supply \u00e2\u0080\u009d section). To this end, the Volkswagen Group set its goal by 2030 to implement energy-efficiency actions at its plants, and thereby to reduce annual energy consumption by 4,900 GWh compared to 2018. A detailed description of these targets can be found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Targets: Climate change \u00e2\u0080\u009d section of this chapter. Climate change adaptation The current strategic focus in the area of climate change is primarily on decarbonization and the associated climate change mitigation, as well as on energy-related topics. The climate dimension is part of our Group sustainability strategy regenerate+ and one of the action areas of our environmental mission statement goToZero. In the context of the risk assessment of our supply chain and sites, we are working on policies/guidelines for climate change adaptation. These will be expanded and integrated into the strategy process in the future. Countermeasures are defined for high risks on a case-by-case basis (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Strategy: Climate change resilience \u00e2\u0080\u009d section for further information). Use of renewable energies Going beyond simply reducing GHG emissions is a central pillar of regenerate+. This is closely aligned with ramping up e-mobility and expanding charging networks and renewable energies. In addition to the Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increased focus on e-mobility, we are concentrating on integrating renewably generated electricity in the use phase and switching the entire power supply for our plants to renewable energy. The Charging and Energy area plays a key role in the Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decarbonization strategy, with the aim of becoming a leading provider of a smart charging and energy ecosystem. As part of the strategic alignment, the Group is focusing on two key areas: Firstly, sales of battery-electric vehicles are being underpinned by the development of a global fast-charging infrastructure. Secondly, the Group is opening up new business models involving smart charging and energy solutions. The Volkswagen Group also aims to achieve its production-related targets in terms of renewable energy through conversion of energy supply. The objective is to be procuring 100% of external electricity from carbon-neutral sources at all sites by 2030. In addition, we aim to generate 1,200 GWh of renewable energy per year through our own and local facilities by 2030. These targets are aligned with our environmental mission statement goTOzero and the strategic vision of the Zero Impact Factory. The Volkswagen Group also has clear targets for decarbonization in the supply chain. One example of this is that in new procurement contracts, suppliers of selected focus components are already contractually obliged to comply with CO 2 e limits. A detailed description of this can be found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Requirements for decarbonization in the supply chain \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. In our Code of Conduct for Business Partners, we require our business partners to take appropriate actions to reduce air emissions that are harmful to the environment and health, including GHG emissions. With a view to improving the environmental compatibility of products and services, we require our business partners to take proactive steps to reduce GHG emissions along the entire supply chain, such as by increasing their use of carbon-neutral energy sources. On request, business partners that deliver products to the Volkswagen Group provide information to us on the total energy consumption in megawatt hours (MWh) and CO 2 e emissions in tons (Scope 1, 2 and 3) at product level. This allows the Volkswagen Group to improve the environmental indicators of our products. We also recommend that our business partners set science- and time-based emission reduction targets as well as targets for the use of renewable energies in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, and to take action to promote decarbonization along the entire value chain. We also recommend that our business partners commit to the Paris Climate Agreement and strive to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. TARGETS: CLIMATE CHANGE Overarching targets The overarching Umweltentlastung Produktion (UEP \u00e2\u0080\u0093 environmental improvement production)\u00e2\u0080\u009d metric includes aspects such as the specific energy consumption and CO 2 e emissions needed to produce a vehicle or component. The corresponding metrics are reported in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Overarching targets and metrics \u00e2\u0080\u009d section of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntroduction to environmental management\u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter. There is also a connection to the impact points method through the inclusion of GHG emissions and energy requirements (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Overarching targets and metrics \u00e2\u0080\u009d section in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntroduction to environmental management\u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter). This concerns, for instance, Scope 1 and 2 emissions and the use of fossil, nuclear, and renewable energy. The site checklist (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Overarching targets and metrics \u00e2\u0080\u009d section in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntroduction to environmental management\u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter) also has a clear link to the topic of climate change through the Energy and CO 2 e action area. The main focus is on energy efficiency and decarbonization. Specific site checklist criteria relating to energy efficiency in production include optimization of the electrical base load during non-production periods, or climate control and ventilation based on use. Criteria relating to decarbonization include external procurement and internal generation of renewable energy. Reduction of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions The Volkswagen Group has set itself the target of reducing absolute GHG emissions in production (Scope 1 and 2) by 50.4% worldwide by 2030 compared with base year 2018. Setting this target is a key milestone on the journey to our goal of net carbon neutrality for the production sites by 2040. The target is in line with the 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C goal of the SBTi, which also validated it. Base year 2018 was defined in the course of certification by the SBTi and based on its requirements. This year is a representative year for production as the structure (type and number of sites) has not changed significantly since then. The baseline value for GHG emissions in 2018 was 9.03 million tons of CO 2 e. Starting in 2030, regular updating of the base year is planned in order to reflect changes in the corporate structure. The target is based on the definitions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions under the GHG Protocol and the ESRS. The reduction targets are accounted for using the market-based method and relate to the GHGs CO 2 , methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs). The data for monitoring the target is collected annually via the EIS in accordance with the internal standard 98000, which is based on the current ESRS specifications. The data is part of the internal Decarbonization Report Production, which is also used for internal target tracking. This objective is aligned with the environmental mission statement goTOzero. For information on stakeholder engagement, see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c General information \u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter. By the end of 2024, the Volkswagen Group had already reduced absolute GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2 combined) by 51% compared with 2018 and therefore already met its 2030 target for reducing greenhouse gases 6 years ahead of schedule. Reduction of Scope 3 GHG emissions in the use phase The Volkswagen Group aims to reduce CO 2 e emissions in the use phase (Scope 3) in the passenger car and light commercial vehicle sector by 30% from 2018 to 2030, which was confirmed by the SBTi as in line with the limitation of global warming to 2\u00c2\u00b0C. This target is aligned with the environmental mission statement goTOzero. The use of battery-electric vehicles plays an important role in achieving this target, in combination with the use of renewable electricity. This is crucial because, to date, around 70% of the CO 2 e emissions from a vehicle with a conventional powertrain arise in the use phase (wheel-to-tank and tank-to-wheel). The Volkswagen Group is anticipating continuous growth in e-mobility worldwide, which should help us achieve this target. The 30% reduction in CO 2 e emissions in the use phase relates to passenger cars and light commercial vehicles worldwide. The baseline value for emissions in the use phase (Scope 3 category 11) was 412,986,695 tons of CO 2 e for 2018 after the recalculation of the base year. This was determined based on the requirements of the SBTi Standard and the GHG Protocol. The objectives were set in line with the requirements of the SBTi, which develops climate roadmaps for various sectors based on scientific findings, and aims to quantify the ambition of the Paris Climate Agreement and implement it in every sector. These targets are reassessed every five years, with the next audit expected to take place in 2025. Potential differences in emission reports are also recorded and assessed in line with the GHG Protocol. The GHG Protocol requires the recalculation of corporate emissions in the event of material new findings or if changes occur. A recalculation of the base year of the current climate action targets for the Scope 3 inventory (2018) was carried out in the reporting year for the first time. A further information about the recalculation of the base year can be found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c CO 2 e emissions over the entire life cycle (DCI) \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. In determining and reviewing internal goals, the Volkswagen Group also considers future developments, such as changes in market requirements and general political and environmental conditions, to work toward ensuring that the emission reduction targets are feasible and constructive even when conditions change. Continuous adjustments to calculation parameters are a contributing factor. Targets are derived and tracked by means of the decarbonization index (DCI). Further information on the parameters is available in the guidelines on compiling the DCI, which is a key indicator for the Volkswagen Group based on life cycle assessment. Increasing energy efficiency at production sites The Volkswagen Group has set itself the goal of implementing energy efficiency actions at the global production sites from 2018 to 2030, with the aim of saving a total of 4.9 million MWh of energy annually. A total of 9,113 actions had already been implemented by 2024, achieving annual savings of 3.5 million MWh. In reporting year 2024 alone, actions with a potential saving of approximately 0.5 million MWh were implemented. The data is part of the internal Decarbonization Report Production, which is also used for internal target tracking, among other things. This objective is aligned with the environmental mission statement goTOzero. For information on stakeholder engagement, see the \u00e2\u0080\u009c General information \u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter. The same information applies to all energy targets. Generating renewable electricity The Volkswagen Group is actively advancing the energy transition at its own sites and has set itself the goal of generating 1.2 million MWh of electricity per year from renewable sources by 2030. The plan is to generate this energy directly at the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production sites worldwide or in their immediate vicinity. A total of 574,801 MWh of electricity was generated from renewable sources in 2024, which represents significant progress compared with the base year 2020 (200,000 MWh). Procurement of electricity in production The Volkswagen Group has set itself the goal of increasing the supply of renewable energy to its plants. It aims to ensure that electricity sourced externally for all sites with the exception of those in China is from 100% renewable sources by 2030. A total of 90.9% of this target was achieved in the base year 2020, and an improvement to 94% had already been achieved by 2024. The goal in China is to supply production sites with 100% carbon-neutral electricity by 2030. This may include electricity from nuclear sources due to the short supply of renewable energy in some provinces of China. Reduction of carbon emissions in the retail and service network The Volkswagen Group has also set itself the ambitious target of reducing the carbon footprint of its global dealership and service partner network for all Group brands as part of the initiative to operate a retail and service network with the lowest possible negative environmental impacts. Based on the first measurement, taken in 2020, in which CO 2 e emissions amounted to a base value of 3.22 million tons, the carbon footprint is to be reduced by at least 30% by 2030, at least 55% by 2040 and at least 75% by 2050. The reduction is measured in absolute percentages and covers the entire retail network, which includes both own retail and the dealerships and service facilities under contract of all Group brands worldwide. This target, which is part of the goTOzero Retail concept, is in line with the environmental mission statement goTOzero, which in turn is committed to the Paris Climate Agreement and to aligning its own activities with the global 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C goal. The carbon footprint is recorded annually directly at the dealerships based on the actual consumption figures of the energy sources. The calculation is supported by in-house carbon emission factors in order to achieve uniform calculation, and is linked to the Volkswagen DCI. This target derivation method was developed with the input of external experts and is based on sources such as the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the China Energy Outlook and Statista. Data to determine the emissions inventory of dealers is collected in accordance with internal standards and norms and is validated annually to ensure it is up to date. This means that the carbon emissions of the entire retail network are measured annually and the results compared with the defined target pathway. The tracking process also includes a regular reconciliation with legal requirements, in order to make any necessary adjustments. The Group uses a business intelligence tool to track targets, which follows the annual recording and review of metrics in order to make statements about milestones and deviations. This identified that the absolute GHG emissions in 2022 were reduced by 0.8 million tons of CO 2 e compared to 2020. The project is progressing as planned. Key decarbonization levers to achieve the GHG emission reduction targets Achieving the Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GHG emission reduction targets is based on four primary levers: (1) e-mobility, (2) conversion of energy supply, (3) energy efficiency and (4) decarbonization in the value chain. Further information on this is provided in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Actions and resources: Climate change \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. Plans to achieve targets through new technology Technology is the key to progress in regenerate+. As the Volkswagen Group, we are one of the few companies in the world that is taking the strategic expansion of technology leadership in e-mobility fully into its own hands \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from cell and battery research to the development and production of battery-electric vehicles. The Volkswagen Group aims to use new technologies to contribute to climate-friendly logistics outside the Group. Beyond its own value chain, the Volkswagen Group also wants to advance decarbonization in other industries in conjunction with MAN Energy Solutions. For example, the company supplies the shipping and energy industry with engines that can be powered by climate-neutral fuels or converts diesel or heavy fuel oil engines to future fuels. The product portfolio is rounded out with solutions in areas including carbon capture, utilization and storage; hydrogen; and heat pump technology. Consideration of climate scenarios with respect to the decarbonization levers The Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climate targets are derived from the SBTi requirements for the transportation sector and are therefore based on factors including the climate scenarios included in those requirements. For example, the SBTi climate scenarios are based on the IEA climate scenarios, as well as other sources. Consequently, the material decarbonization levers were identified based on an analysis of the DCI and the emissions inventory. The Volkswagen Group also uses model data and assumptions in a variety of contexts to make forward-looking statements. As a member of the IEA Transport project working group, for example, we use the IEA APS, STEPS and NZW scenarios, which are based on the GEC model[1]. The focus is on the 2030 target year, which represents a milestone on the path to the goal of Group net CO 2 e neutrality by 2050 and acts as a reference for internal metrics. The scenario analysis focuses on the areas of production, sales and technology, the impact of products, and materials procurement. It shows that a significant reduction in emission intensity per vehicle is needed to achieve the UN climate goals, particularly in view of increasing unit sales. CO 2 e emissions over the entire life cycle (DCI) In the decarbonization index (DCI), we have a informative instrument that makes our progress and interim results in the area of decarbonization transparent and comprehensible and is recorded using software developed in-house. The methodology is based on the GHG Protocol and is published in its guidance 2 . The DCI measures the CO 2 e emissions by the brands that produce passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in the regions of Europe (EU27, United Kingdom, Norway and Iceland), China (including the Chinese joint ventures) and the USA over the entire life cycle. In this index, the use phase is calculated over 200,000 km per vehicle and with reference to region-specific fleet values without statutory flexibilities. The intensity of the CO 2 e emissions from the electricity used to charge battery-electric vehicles is also calculated on the basis of region-specific energy mixes. Vehicle maintenance is not taken into account here. Our vehicle life cycle assessments, which are used as the data basis for calculating supply chain and recycling emissions, have been verified externally and independently in accordance with the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards. Scope 3 also includes emissions from other Group entities and regions in some categories (see \u00e2\u0080\u009cMetrics on Scope 3 GHG emissions\u00e2\u0080\u009d section for a detailed description). The DCI calculation methodology is regularly adjusted depending on internal and external requirements, such as new test cycles for fleet emissions. Published DCI values can therefore also be adjusted to the new methodology and changed to facilitate the presentation of a time series that is methodologically consistent. In the reporting year, the DCI value averaged 48.0 tons of CO 2 e per vehicle. This represents a reduction of 0.9 tons of CO 2 e per vehicle compared with the previous year (after recalculation). This is primarily due to lower emissions in the supply chain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for example, as a result of a shift in the portfolio toward vehicles in smaller vehicle segments, as well as the China region having a lower share in the overall production volume and due to lower emissions in the use phase as a result of reduced fleet emissions. The GHG Protocol requires the recalculation of corporate emissions in the event of material new findings or if changes occur. There may be various reasons to remeasure previous years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 emissions to enable a fair comparison with current emissions. These include structural changes in the company, changes in the calculation method, an increase in the precision of emission factors, activity data, and findings regarding significant errors. At the Volkswagen Group, changes to the calculation are decided annually in a set process. A recalculation of the previous year (2023) and the base year of the current climate action targets for the Scope 3 inventory (2018) and for all DCI values since 2018 was carried out in the reporting year for the first time. Changed calculation assumptions were generally taken into account for the recalculation if the expected overall effect on the DCI was more than 0.1 tons of CO 2 e per vehicle in the base year of the current climate change mitigation targets (2018). The recalculation includes the following topics: use of WLTP instead of NEDC consumption data to calculate the use phase (since 2021) availability of region-specific life cycle assessments for the China market (since 2022) use of updated and more precise emission factors for fossil fuels (since 2024) correction of a calculation error for vehicle-specific logistics emissions (until 2022) use of company-specific cutting rates for steel and aluminum components in production instead of generic data (aluminum since 2022, steel since 2023) and calculation of generic life cycle assessments with 0% recycled aluminum content (since 2022): All new vehicle life cycle assessments in the Volkswagen Group are calculated on the basis of the new calculation assumptions. Because life cycle assessments for vehicles based on the previous calculation assumptions are still being used to calculate supply chain emissions, recalculation of the base year value is subject to a phase-in. use of specific data for the emissions of Group franchises (in particular car dealerships) instead of generic figures (since 2022) inclusion of the Bentley and Lamborghini brands in the DCI (since 2020): The effect on the Group decarbonization index is below the threshold of 0.1 tons of CO 2 e per vehicle, but a change in the scope of decarbonization index reporting under the rules defined by the Volkswagen Group itself in accordance with the GHG Protocol will in any case lead to a recalculation of emissions in the base year. transition of emission factors (since 2024) including inflation adjustment (since 2023) for reporting Scope 3 categories 2, 8 and 13: The GHG Protocol allows for historical datapoints and changes in data that are not available to be determined via backcasting in the context of base year recalculation. In this case, specific data for categories 13 and 14 is used: In category 14, the DCI effect from 2021 (based on primary data first collected for 2020), and in category 13 the share of the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own leased vehicles (first available for 2022) are applied to the preceding years. Backcasting with average values is also used in categories 8 and 13, where individual datapoints for which there is no data for 2018 in line with the current methodology are replaced with the mean values of 2019 to 2023. Based on the recalculation described in the above list, the chart below shows homogenized performance of the DCI since 2018 in terms of the data basis and calculation method. The DCI values for 2018 and 2019 were calculated using a simplified method based on the Scope 3 inventory. Among other things, this involved changing the data basis for vehicle volumes (primarily for the use phase) in Europe from preliminary production volume to the final number of vehicle registrations, as this corresponds more closely to the volume (sales) to be used in accordance with the GHG Protocol. The values for the past years displayed in the chart differ from the DCI values published in those years due to the calculation adjustments explained in the above list. Download DECARBONIZATION INDEX Unit 2024 2023 Notes Decarbonization index * \u00e2\u0094\u0082GRI 305-4 WLTP tons of CO 2 e per vehicle 48.0 48.9 (47.3) The metric includes brands producing passenger car and light commercial vehicles in the Europe (EU27, United Kingdom, Norway and Iceland), China and USA regions. The main drivers of change in the reduction in the DCI by 0.9 tons of CO 2 e per vehicle are portfolio and regional shifts. The DCI for 2023 and 2024 is reported without taking offset measures into account. To enable comparability, the DCI reported in 2023 (47.3 tons of CO 2 e per vehicle) was adjusted to new calculation assumptions as part of the recalculation of the base year. * strategic metric DCI [t CO 2 e/vehicle] ACTIONS AND RESOURCES: CLIMATE CHANGE With regard to the hierarchy of actions described in the transition plan, various decarbonization levers were defined as part of efforts to further decarbonize the Volkswagen Group. The Volkswagen Group has identified actions along these decarbonization levers to mitigate climate change. The first major decarbonization lever is e-mobility. As technology advances, the automotive industry is rapidly forging ahead with the associated transformation toward e-mobility and digitalization. The market for battery-electric vehicles is expected to continue to grow in the next few years, meaning that the cost-efficient and sustainable production of battery systems and the expansion of the charging infrastructure will be crucial to success. From today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective, around 90% of the decarbonization targeted by the Volkswagen Group can be realized through electrification of the fleet and switching to renewably generated energy. Consistent charging with 100% electricity from renewable sources alone would reduce all CO 2 e emissions by almost half compared to the normal EU power mix. The Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initiative means that the same amount of electricity generated through renewable sources is fed into the grid as the Volkswagen e-vehicle fleet consumes over its lifetime. It is therefore possible to guarantee that the Volkswagen fleet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use phase is almost net CO 2 e-free. The Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second key decarbonization lever is conversion of energy supply. The Volkswagen Group is increasingly focusing on switching the power supply for its production sites to renewable energy. Moreover, the Volkswagen Group directly supports the expansion of renewable energy on an industrial scale, by planning new wind farms and solar parks in various regions of Europe, among other projects. The energy attribute certificates (EACs) of the installations are obtained for ten years under long-term contracts and provide guarantees of origin for the renewable electricity. In this context, the Volkswagen Group is invested in several solar parks in Germany and Spain, as well as wind farms in Sweden and other countries. The wind farm supported by Volkswagen in northern Sweden, of which the Volkswagen Group has purchased 70% of all EACs, is one of the largest onshore wind farms in Europe. Increasing energy efficiency is a third decarbonization lever. Energy-efficient vehicle production is therefore a core element of the Zero Impact Factory strategic vision. Various actions are being implemented at production sites to increase energy efficiency, including improvements to ventilation technology, installing LED lighting, load-dependent dryer control and/or the implementation of load-dependent plant control. Value chain decarbonization is the fourth and final essential lever to achieve the GHG emission reduction targets. We consider the environmental impact our products cause throughout the entire life cycle and at all stages of their value chain. This includes the manufacturing process with the associated extraction of raw materials, material manufacturing, supplier processes and our own production at our sites; the use phase with the resulting vehicle emissions and the necessary supply of charging current and fuel, and ultimately the dismantling of the scrap vehicle at the end of its life cycle. No decarbonization without e-mobility The Volkswagen Group cannot achieve decarbonization without a transition to e-mobility. Battery-electric vehicles play a central role here, as they do not cause any local emissions during use and their CO 2 e footprint is better throughout their life cycles than comparable vehicles with internal combustion engines (gasoline or diesel). The consistent electrification of our fleet paves the way to net carbon-neutral mobility for our customers, too. Our battery-electric vehicles are manufactured at 18 sites in Europe, China and the USA. The Modular Electric Drive Matrix ( MEB ) and Premium Platform Electric ( PPE ) serve as the technical backbone of the electrification campaign. The e-offensive is to be continued with the modular vehicle platform still under development, Scalable Systems Platform ( SSP ), with the aim of offering battery-electric vehicle across all brand Groups. The Volkswagen Group systematically pursued its e-offensive in 2024, and will continue to do so. For instance, the reporting year saw the market launches of further all-electric models under various Group brands including the Volkswagen ID.BUZZ LWB (Long Wheel-Base), the CUPRA Tavascan, the Audi A6 e-tron, the Audi Q6 e-tron, the Porsche Taycan and the Porsche Macan. For information on the measure\u00e2\u0080\u0099s progress, refer to the \u00e2\u0080\u009c Metrics on Scope 3 GHG emissions \u00e2\u0080\u009d section. We are also working on improving efficiency in many models, such as with the highly efficient APP550 modular electric drive which will first be used in the ID.7. The entire ID. family has also had sustainability upgrades, including the use of recycled materials such as SEAQUAL polyester yarn made from recycled marine plastic. In addition, we are taking the next steps in the area of portfolio transformation by realigning the entire architecture of our vehicles, for example through the Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partnership with US battery-electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian. The aim of the partnership is to develop next generation software-defined vehicle ( SDV ) architectures to be used in future vehicles of both companies. The joint venture builds on Rivian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software and electrical architecture to facilitate the joint development of best-in-class architectures and software for the SDVs of both partners. Conversion of energy supply Climate change mitigation in manufacturing Volkswagen is also paying particular attention to restructuring its own electricity generation. For example, the conversion of the power plants in Wolfsburg from coal to natural gas for the Wolfsburg North/South cogeneration plant, which commenced in 2018, was completed at the end of 2021. Commissioning of the new gas and steam turbine facilities in the Wolfsburg West cogeneration plant was completed in December 2023. The last coal blocks in the Wolfsburg West cogeneration plant were taken out of service on April 1, 2024. The Volkswagen Group is pushing ahead with efforts to supply its own plants with electricity from renewable sources. To date, 73 sites worldwide have been supplied with external electricity from 100% renewable energy sources. In 2024, more than half (66.9%) of total global electricity consumption was accounted for by electricity from renewable sources. Compared with the previous year, this is a rise of 10.6%. Volkswagen is also increasingly focusing on generating renewable energy at its sites and in their immediate vicinity. A total of 574,801 MWh of electricity from renewable sources was generated at the sites in 2024. Net CO 2 e-neutral use phase The Volkswagen Group is committed to achieving a net CO 2 e-neutral use phase for its battery-electric vehicles fleet by expanding the use of renewable energy. It is particularly important to ensure that the use phase of the vehicles is net CO 2 e-neutral in the long term, as a large proportion of CO 2 e emissions are generated during operation. The use of electricity from renewable sources will therefore play a key role as the emissions are reduced. In the EU, for example, almost half of the EU power mix is of non-renewable origin. The Volkswagen Group offsets the amount of gray electricity (electricity from fossil energy sources) in the power mix of the entire fleet charging processes, as determined by a transparency study. To this end, VW Kraftwerk GmbH, Wolfsburg/Germany concludes long-term (ten-year) purchase agreements for green electricity certificates (EAC) with new renewable energy plants using a balance sheet approach. During the contract period, the green electricity certificates of the plants are withdrawn from the market. This balances the calculated amount of gray electricity share during the fixed use phase of 200,000 km. This ensures almost CO 2 e-neutral mobility for our customers in Europe during the use phase. Energy efficiency Increasing vehicle efficiency In addition to the increase in renewable energies, decarbonization is also being driven by the increase in vehicle efficiency. This efficiency is basically controlled and continuously implemented by system options designed to reduce energy consumption during vehicle operation. For example, driving mode selection supports fuel-efficient driving via one option. In addition, there are recommendations for changing gear in the case of manual-transmission vehicles. An battery-electric vehicle route planner is optionally available in the electric ID. models for efficient route planning. The ID.7 provides one example of Increasing vehicle efficiency: Intelligent design for improved aerodynamics: Sophisticated aerodynamics make the ID.7 an efficiency champion. The technology reduces energy consumption and enables ranges of up to 700 kilometers (WLTP) and lower charging costs. The streamlined basic design, the low drag coefficient (cd value) of 0.23 and the front surface area of 2.46 m 2 are the result of close collaboration between design and development. In the case of saloon like the ID.7, about 50 percent of the cd value depends on the body shape. The ID.7 has an almost entirely closed underbody and therefore offers as little air resistance as possible. Newly developed wheel spoilers on the front wheels, side air curtains on the front bumper and flared side skirts are also effective. As the wheels also significantly impact aerodynamics (approximately 30% of the cd vehicle drag is caused by the air flowing around the wheels), we have developed special AERO aluminum wheel rims and aerodynamically efficient tires. Optimizing the electric motor: An electric motor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efficiency is a crucial factor affecting its power and the range of the vehicle. This is measured as the ratio of electrical energy used to mechanical power generated. Higher efficiency therefore means less energy is lost in the form of heat and friction. The Volkswagen Group accordingly optimized the electric motor for the ID.7, reducing its carbon footprint while increasing its power. Energy efficiency in manufacturing Increasing energy efficiency is an important element of our decarbonization strategy. A total of 9,113 actions had already been implemented by 2024, achieving annual savings of 3.5 million MWh. In reporting year 2024 alone, actions with a potential saving of approximately 0.5 million MWh were implemented, including, for example, improvements to ventilation technology, heat recovery, load-dependent dryer control and/or the implementation of load-dependent plant control. Decarbonization in the value chain Battery production capacity The Volkswagen Group is one of the few automotive manufacturers around the world that is adopting a hands-on approach to the battery as a core e-mobility technology. The formation of the subsidiary PowerCo SE, Salzgitter/Germany in 2022 integrated the development and production of battery cells into the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own value chain, thus keeping a significant part of the added value of the battery-electric vehicle within the Group. From the new European battery hub in Salzgitter, this company manages the development of international factory operations, continuous development of cell technology, vertical integration of the value chain and supplies of machinery and equipment to factories. The battery activities are primarily intended to substantially reduce the complexity and cost of this key technology so as to make battery-electric vehicles attractive and affordable for as many people as possible. They also enable a greater degree of technological independence. The main key concepts of PowerCo are the unified cell, the standard factory concept, and vertical integration of the value chain. In the reporting year, three Group-owned sites for battery cell production were under construction, including the main plant in Salzgitter, Valencia/Spain, and St. Thomas/Canada. All sites are to be consistently operated with electricity from low-carbon sources. PowerCo strongly committed to the reduction of CO 2 e emissions along the entire battery cell production value chain. Strict requirements are placed on suppliers and monitored in the upstream value chain, including the use of certified electricity from renewable sources and compliance with fixed CO 2 e limits. Continuous decarbonization actions are also planned in logistics. PowerCo is pursuing ambitious decarbonization strategies in production, which, in addition to using low-carbon electricity, include for example energy saving measures such as innovative dry coating technologies, and reducing production waste and material consumption. PowerCo is working toward using low-carbon recycled materials and establishing the recycling of production waste. In collaboration with the Volkswagen Group, PowerCo is also forging ahead with the development of end-of-life battery recycling. Finally, PowerCo is investing in the development of low-carbon future technologies and the use of alternative materials in order to further optimize the carbon footprint of battery cells. Requirements for decarbonization in the supply chain In new contracts for high-voltage batteries for the European market, suppliers are already obliged to comply with CO 2 e limits. In the case of existing supply contracts for current MEB vehicle projects, suppliers are required to use certified power from renewable sources in their production. For new vehicle projects such as initial use of the SSP, the Volkswagen Group intends to make CO 2 e emissions a technical feature for relevant components. This means that binding CO 2 e targets will be set for suppliers within the EU, and they must demonstrate compliance with these at all times. This applies to certain components for the European market. One example is the new SSP mechatronics platform on which the batteries are assigned a CO 2 e limit. To achieve these limits, suppliers need to implement actions in their own production processes and upstream supply chains \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for example, the use of renewable energy. The Volkswagen Group is using actions of this kind to reduce emissions in its value chain and the carbon footprint of many battery-electric vehicle models. Volkswagen Group China is also working together with its suppliers on a more sustainable supply chain. For example, together with suppliers and partners, the Group is developing a roadmap for the transition to 100% renewable energies by 2030. To date, more than 500 suppliers have already signed a declaration committing to switching to electricity from renewable energy sources. Zero Impact Logistics The actions the Volkswagen Group is taking to achieve net carbon-neutral logistics in the future include, for example, the ongoing shift of shipments from road to rail and almost complete avoidance of CO 2 e emissions through the use of green electricity generated from renewable energy sources on the electrified lines in rail transport in Germany and other European countries in collaboration with railway companies. This is an important contribution to reducing GHG emissions in the value chain. However, the prerequisites for this include sufficient available capacity in the railway network infrastructure, particularly in Germany. There is also a focus on preparing for the use of completely battery-electric trucks and biogenic fuels in the truck network. The Volkswagen Group also transports high-voltage batteries for battery-electric vehicles in an environmentally conscious and efficient manner, for example at the component site in Braunschweig. Here, the batteries are loaded fully automatically onto trains that run on renewable power, which then take them to the plant in Zwickau. Group Logistics uses thirteen roll-on/roll-off charter ships, two of which are powered by low-pollution liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) to transport vehicles across the North Atlantic. By the end of 2024, four more LNG-powered car freighters had been gradually introduced on this route, replacing a total of six conventionally powered ships. Group Logistics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 charter ships are more climate-friendly than other LNG-fueled marine engines because the high-pressure technology of the two-stroke engines from MAN Energy Solutions means that virtually no methane escapes. In principle, the dual-fuel engines will also enable non-fossil fuels \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as biogas (bio-LNG), e-gas (synthetic gas) from renewables, or biofuel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to be used in future. This will allow carbon emissions to be reduced even further. Since 2021, Group Logistics has been continuously operating two charter ships on European sea routes using biofuel, which produces less CO 2 e than conventional fossil fuels. The raw material for the biofuel is made up of used cooking oils and fats. These waste and residual materials, originating from industries such as catering and food production, cannot be processed into food or animal feed. Decarbonization of the dealership networks Since 2022, the carbon footprint of the entire retail and service network has been recorded annually in category 14 \u00e2\u0080\u009cFranchises\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Scope 3 GHG emissions. To identify and successfully implement the correct actions for decarbonization and to reduce environmental impacts, we provide the businesses with manuals, training and marketing materials, such as a comprehensive guidebook, online training and videos on customer communication. In addition, the Volkswagen Group has developed a cross-brand certification system for the entire retail network \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the goTOzero RETAIL certification. This is based on established systems such as the ISO 14001 standard, building certifications and rating systems and also covers a dealership\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core business. Although goTOzero RETAIL was only introduced in 2023, some dealerships have already achieved gold and platinum certification status. All 50 key retail markets, which alone account for 95% of the worldwide retail and service network, are to progressively be included in the goTOzero RETAIL certification. Currently, the scope of the certification is being expanded to \u00e2\u0080\u009cFull ESG\u00e2\u0080\u009d, with a focus on environmental issues. The success and progress of the goTOzero RETAIL project is demonstrated through regular internal and external communication. In addition to the certifications, an energy and resource consulting concept has been developed, which is available to all markets and partner companies. The Volkswagen Group strives for maximum energy efficiency possible and the use of renewable energy for new and existing dealership and service buildings to the extent this is economically and technically feasible. Net carbon-neutral handover of battery-electric vehicles In 2022, the Volkswagen Group decided to take the voluntary measure of making the delivery of a number of the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery-electric vehicles to our customers in Europe net carbon neutral. Until the Volkswagen Group can avoid CO 2 e emissions entirely and use renewable energies everywhere, we will voluntarily offset the remaining GHG emissions from our supply chain, production and logistics. This applies to MEB vehicles from the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Audi, Porsche, SEAT/CUPRA, and \u00c5 koda brands in Europe. In 2024, the offset amount was 6.7 million tons of CO 2 e for the Group. This action will continue into 2025 and will end with the 2025 reporting year for the Group. As part of net carbon-neutral delivery, we offset unavoidable emissions from the two life cycle phases of the supply chain or production through climate action projects with high certification standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), the Climate Community and Biodiversity Standards (CCB Standards) and the Gold Standard. In addition to external certification standards, we also assess offsetting projects for quality assurance in accordance with our own criteria. We consider protection of natural carbon sinks and development of additional carbon sinks to be a vital task in climate change mitigation, which is why the Volkswagen Group is committed to developing its own climate action projects via the joint venture Volkswagen ClimatePartner GmbH. It develops and funds certified climate action projects that serve the recognized offsetting of CO 2 e emissions. One key requirement for all projects is that they must meet the highest quality standards. For this reason, the joint venture also takes control of quality assurance. Core aspects include the additionality, accuracy and permanence of the emission reductions, the socioeconomic and environmental benefits for the region, and regular audit by independent third parties. The initial project standards are the VCS and the Gold Standard. The joint venture commenced its operational work in 2022 and is focusing on forest protection projects and nature-based solutions. It is accompanied by a specially established independent project advisory board. Contribution to climate-friendly logistics and hard-to-abate sectors Beyond its own value chain, the Volkswagen Group also wants to advance decarbonization in other industries together with the MAN Energy Solutions subsidiary. For example, the company also supplies the global shipping and energy industry with engines that can be powered by more climate-friendly fuels (future fuels) and converts diesel or heavy fuel oil engines to future fuels. MAN Energy Solution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portfolio helps customers reduce emissions, use energy more efficiently and deploy environmentally friendly fuel alternatives. With a broad range of key future technologies, industry-leading digitalization services and a wide portfolio of durable products, the company provides sustainable answers to today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climate challenges. In addition to climate-friendly engines, the portfolio also includes key technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage; heat pumps; and hydrogen production plants. Charging and energy activities The Volkswagen Group is one of the driving forces behind e-mobility and is resolutely pressing ahead with the expansion of the charging network worldwide. The Charging and Energy area plays an important role in the Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s e-mobility strategy as part of the 10-point program, and is developing integrated energy solutions for private and commercial customers worldwide through its own brands. The Volkswagen Group is accelerating the expansion of the charging infrastructure worldwide through the Group brands Electrify America (North America), Elli (Europe) and the CAMS joint venture (China). This remains a key requirement in ramping up e-mobility and decarbonizing individual mobility. The aim is to establish more than 40,000 fast-charging points around the world in the medium term, with more than half of them installed so far. The largest fast-charging networks are already operated in the growth regions of China and the USA/Canada. The Volkswagen Group is increasingly supporting sustainable energy projects and developing new business models relating to energy in order to promote power from renewable sources for charging and the expansion of renewable energy. The aim is to charge battery-electric vehicles with electricity from renewable sources and thereby exploit their full potential. Europe As a charging and energy company operating across Europe, the Elli brand has set itself the task of supporting private and commercial clients with intelligent hardware and software solutions in the sustainable energy transition and advancing the decarbonization of society. The Elli brand was formed as a Volkswagen Group subsidiary in 2018 and is now one of the leading providers of a smart charging and energy ecosystem. The product range is broad and includes AC wallboxes and flexible quick-charging stations (Flexpole), public charging services, software solutions, energy trading, and electricity supply. An example of the products for the interface between energy and mobility is the new unidirectional wallbox Elli Charger 2, which, in conjunction with the private PV system and the Elli brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dynamic electricity tariff, reduces charging costs for customers by up to 40%. The Elli brand also offers the Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers as well as commercial and private clients outside the Group access to Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest charging network with some 850,000 charge points \u00e2\u0080\u0093 via a single app or charging cards. The Selected Partner Network established in 2024 comprises premium charge point operators and has optimal charging stations, a high-performance charging infrastructure with on-site convenience services (for example caf\u00c3\u00a9s, restaurants, sanitary facilities) and a high level of operational safety. In addition, the Volkswagen Group is actively expanding fast charging points in Europe via joint ventures. Together with other manufacturers, the Volkswagen Group established the IONITY joint venture in 2017, which had set up 4,700 fast-charging stations on major highways across Europe by the end of 2024. The process of decarbonizing society increases the need for storage solutions for regenerative energy, in order to ensure stability and efficiency in the electrical distribution system. Vehicle batteries can act as a key asset and powerbank in this regard. Elli\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medium-term vision for the future is a managed battery network, in which batteries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as mass storage, battery-electric vehicle, residential or commercial building \u00e2\u0080\u0093 can be connected to form a standardized, networked virtual power plant. This future ecosystem will not only support the grid when demand is high, but also provide access to the electricity spot markets, to provide customers with financial incentives to make the timing of their electricity demand more flexible. The aim is also to tap into new profit pools for the Volkswagen Group. In this context, the Elli brand received a license for electricity trading on Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest electricity exchange (EPEX) back in July 2023 and is marketing the flexibility of the electricity market in the first storage testing center in Kassel (Baunatal). North America The Group brand Electrify America is the largest public hyper-fast-charging network in the US. It made a significant contribution to the development of a national network of fast-charging points for communities and highways, and to the increasing introduction of zero-emission vehicles . Electrify America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fast-charging network has expanded significantly since installation of the first charging station in May 2018. The network now comprises over 1,000 charging stations and more than 4,700 hyper-fast charge points. Electrify America launched the Electrify America Solar Glow\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 1 solar photovoltaic project in San Bernardino County, California, in August 2023. Electrify America Solar Glow\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 1 is an important milestone in Electrify America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to reduce the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy carbon footprint. The park has more than 200,000 solar panels and generates an estimated 75 MW at peak capacity, which is comparable to the power drawn by 500 battery-electric vehicles charging at once at an average speed of 150 kilowatts. The solar park is the result of a 15-year virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with developer Terra-Gen. Electrify America is the largest open network of DC fast charging points for battery-electric vehicles in the US to enter into a virtual power purchase agreement for new renewable energy generation. Electrify America Solar Glow\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 1 contributes to the additionality of energy generation from renewable sources. China As of December 31, 2024, the CAMS joint venture has installed 1,621 charging stations with over 13,000 charging points in 213 cities in China and they have over 6.6 million registered users. CAMS is also active in the field of energy services. At the beginning of 2024, for example, four carbon-neutral charging stations began operating in Guangdong (China), contributing to decarbonization. In addition, the Volkswagen Group is working with a range of partners on projects to improve the stability of energy supply and promote electricity generation from renewable sources. For example, Volkswagen Group China launched a V1G pilot project with State Grid in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei cluster in December 2023 to improve interaction between vehicles and the grid, achieve balance in electricity supply and demand, and help stabilize the power grid. Dependency on resources for implementation of actions The sustainable transformation will require extensive investment in digitalization and electrification. Among other things, the digital transformation ensures that actions for climate change mitigation can be implemented. The budget designated for this purpose is also determined by the sustainable transformation, among other factors. The cost-intensive transformation is also associated with the financing and attractiveness of the Volkswagen Group for investors seeking sustainable investment opportunities. The Volkswagen Group has had a Green Finance Framework for various forms of financing since 2020, such as green bonds, which define the framework for financial instruments geared to sustainability. In the reporting period, we refinanced taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure from fiscal years 2021 through 2023 based on the Green Finance Framework updated in October 2022 by issuing green bonds in the amount of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.0 billion . The Volkswagen Group has issued a total of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac10.5 billion in green bonds to refinance capital expenditure for battery-electric vehicles since 2020. In 2022, the Volkswagen Group published a revised Green Finance Framework that was further developed in particular through the integration of the EU Taxonomy. As was the case in the previous Green Finance Framework, the Volkswagen Group continues to focus on the exclusive inclusion of battery-electric vehicles in sustainable financing. Under the updated Green Finance Framework, only taxonomy-aligned investments will be considered. This links our corporate objective of net carbon neutrality by 2050 with our financing strategy. The funds raised under the Green Finance Framework are specifically used to refinance environmentally friendly projects such as e-mobility. This both fulfills the clean transportation category of the Green Bond Principles of the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) and is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and the European Union. The success of the updated Green Finance Framework has been confirmed by Sustainalytics to comply with the ICMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Green Bond Principles and the Green Loan Principles of the Loan Market Association (LMA). Taxonomy-related CapEx and OpEx Expanding e-mobility is the most important lever for our transformation. Our actions to expand e-mobility are in line with economic activity 3.3. Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport. The relevant disclosure requirements of ESRS E1 paragraph 29 c can be found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c EU Taxonomy \u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter of the report. Differences concerning operating expenditure and capital expenditure The data disclosed under this standard on capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) is in line with the information reported on CapEx and OpEx in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c EU Taxonomy \u00e2\u0080\u009d chapter. There are therefore no differences to disclose. METRICS: CLIMATE CHANGE Group standard 98000 sets out indicators for emissions and energy which are tracked uniformly by all sites worldwide. They include GHG emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), nitrous oxide (N2O), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The data collected with respect to energy includes generation, purchase and use of fossil, nuclear and renewable energy sources, including the use of combustible materials. Energy consumption and mix For the purposes of data collection, the energy consumption and energy mixes of the worldwide production sites are recorded annually. Both self-generated energy and energy procured from external suppliers (purchased electricity) are taken into account. In addition, the renewable and nuclear shares of the energy mix are recorded separately. The relevant portion that comes from non-fuel-based renewable sources such as wind power or photovoltaics is also recorded. The Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality criteria must be observed and appropriate documentation provided when procuring renewable energies. Quantitative metrics for energy consumption and mix are described in the following (see table): Download ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND MIX 2024 2023 Unit Volks\u00c2\u00adwagen Group Companies with operational control Volks\u00c2\u00adwagen Group Companies with operational control Total energy consumption million MWh 19.0 5.5 19.4 6.3 Total energy consumption of Volkswagen Group & companies with operational control million MWh 24.6 25.8 Energy consumption from fossil sources 1 million MWh 11.9 3.7 13.5 5.0 Coal and coal products million MWh 0.8 1.0 2.3 1.0 Crude oil and petroleum products million MWh 1.1 0.02 1.3 0.04 Natural gas million MWh 8.7 1.1 8.6 1.4 Fuel from other fossil sources million MWh 0.1 0.0 0.1 0.0 Purchased energy from fossil sources 1 million MWh 1.2 1.6 1.3 2.5 Energy consumption from nuclear sources 2 million MWh 0.04 0.1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Energy consumption from renewable sources million MWh 7.1 1.7 5.9 1.4 Fuel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 renewable million MWh 1.0 0.5 0.5 0.5 Purchased energy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 renewable 1 million MWh 6.0 1.2 5.5 0.9 Purchased energy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 renewable, electric million MWh 5.7 1.1 5.2 0.8 Share of renewable electricity purchased bundled 2 % 65.4 0.9 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Share of renewable electricity purchased unbundled 2 % 34.6 99.1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Self-generated energy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 renewable, non-fuel 2 million MWh 0.04 0.0 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1 The datapoint contains estimated values 2 No reporting possible for 2023 The information for 2023 is provided voluntarily and has not been externally validated. Contractual instruments for the procurement of renewable electricity A distinction is made regarding procurement of electricity from renewable sources between bundled and unbundled procurement. Bundled means that the certificates of origin, renewable energy certificates or green electricity certificates are purchased together with the green electricity product (not separately) from a supplier. A distinction is currently made between the following contracts: On-site power purchase agreements Off-site power purchase agreements Other contracts Energy intensity Energy intensity is calculated based on the total energy consumption and sales revenue. Sales revenue is taken from the consolidated financial statements, where more detailed information can be found. The energy intensity metric is reported excluding the companies with operational control. Download ENERGY INTENSITY IN HIGH CLIMATE IMPACT SECTORS Unit 2024 Energy intensity for activities in high climate impact sectors (energy consumption per sales revenue) kWh/\u00e2\u0082\u00ac 0.059 Total energy consumption from activities in high climate impact sectors 1 million MWh 19.0 Sales revenue from activities in high climate impact sectors million \u00e2\u0082\u00ac 324,656 Total sales revenue (financial statements) million \u00e2\u0082\u00ac 324,656 1 Corresponds to total energy consumption High climate impact sectors to determine energy intensity All activities within the Volkswagen Group contribute to vehicle production and relate to NACE code C.29.10 (Manufacture of motor vehicles). They are therefore associated with activities in high climate impact sectors. Since all of the Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities are included in the calculation of energy intensity, total energy consumption is used here for the calculation. MAN Energy Solutions is also included in the energy intensity calculation. Energy generation Self-generated energy includes energy from plants owned, rented, or leased and operated by the Volkswagen Group (for example, power plants, cogeneration plants, boiler houses.). This also applies to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own energy generation systems operated by third parties.

The information for 2023 is provided voluntarily and has not been externally validated. GHG emissions Metrics on Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions Scope 1 GHG emissions are direct GHG emissions that are generated by the Volkswagen Group through sources it controls itself, such as through the use of fuels at the sites. Direct biogenic CO 2 emissions (Scope 1) are emissions that result from the use of biogenic fuels at the sites. The Verband der Automobilindustrie (VDA \u00e2\u0080\u0093 German Association of the Automotive Industry) emission factors are used to calculate the emissions. Scope 2 GHG emissions are indirect CO 2 emissions from energy generation that are generated as a result of purchasing energy from external power plants, cogeneration plants and boiler houses and released elsewhere. Scope 2 GHG emissions are calculated using both the market-based and location-based methods in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Indirect location-based biogenic CO 2 emissions are emissions that result from the use of biogenic fuels by external energy suppliers (for example generation of electrical energy or heat) and are assessed using local emission factors. The current VDA emission factors are used to calculate the emissions.

Methodologies, assumptions and emission factors used to measure Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions The GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) of the production sites are calculated annually pursuant to the requirements of the GHG Protocol and the ESRS. Provider-specific factors are applied for market-based CO 2 emission calculation, whereas VDA emission factors are used for location-based measurement. The total GHG emissions of the site are determined by adding all relevant emissions, each multiplied by their global warming potential. The CO 2 emission factors for energy not generated on site (for example electrical energy, district heating, district cooling) are obtained from or provided by the relevant energy suppliers. The CO 2 emission factors for own consumption of primary energy sources for heat or power generation are calculated from the heating values or calorific values of the fuels and the efficiency of the own generation system. We use the electricity grid mix of the country in question to calculate the location-based Scope 2 emissions. Identifying and disclosing material Scope 3 categories Metrics on Scope 3 GHG emissions In line with the Scope 3 standard published by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute, we are reporting CO 2 e emissions for 13 out of a total of 15 Scope 3 categories in 2024. Category 9 (Downstream transportation and distribution) is included in the reporting on category 4. Additionally, category 10 (Processing of sold products) is included in the reporting on Scope 1 GHG emissions. Category 15 includes emissions from various types of investments and is not reported due to low materiality at Group level. Around 21.4% of all Scope 3 emissions fall under the emission category Purchased goods and services, while 72.7% arise during the use phase (well-to-wheel). The following tables show the Scope 3 emissions of the Volkswagen Group, the TRATON GROUP and MAN Energy Solutions, including notes on methodology for data collection and calculation: Download VOLKSWAGEN GROUP Scope 3 category Unit 2024 2023 Notes Total Scope 3 GHG emissions million tons of CO 2 e 408.58 429.12 (413.95) 1 The previous year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s figure was adjusted as part of the recalculation of the base year.

They were calculated on the basis of 72 production-volume-weighted life cycle assessments (LCAs). All vehicle LCAs for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles have been independently certified in accordance with ISO 14040/44, mainly by T\u00c3\u009cV NORD CERT GmbH. Key drivers of change include portfolio and regional shifts and lower production figures. The previous year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s figure was adjusted as part of the recalculation of the base year. The Volkswagen Group uses the electricity grid mix as standard for assessing the production phase of vehicles and, at the same time, includes certificates for renewable energies from suppliers to highlight common decarbonization efforts. This combination of location-based and market-based approaches may result in slight double counting of the proportion of renewable energy. A fully market-based approach will be possible as soon as the relevant emission factors are available in the databases the Volkswagen Group uses.

Purchased services (IT, accessories, packaging, sales marketing) were not included due to their minimal impact (<1%). Scania combines similar products into eight reference groups, using production volumes and an internal material data system (SMDS) with external life cycle assessment (LCA) data. MAN Truck & Bus applies life cycle assessments for vehicle categories by using sales data, average weight calculations and expert estimates. For International, this datapoint is calculated by ClimatePartner. Volkswagen Truck & Bus (VWTB) calculates the emissions from the volumes of the components and uses ecoinvent emission factors based on technical calculations. Category 2: Capital goods tons of CO 2 e \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Included in the Volkswagen Group figure Category 3: Fuel- and energy-related emissions (not included in Scope 1 or 2) tons of CO 2 e \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The production sites\u00e2\u0080\u0099 emissions are included in the Volkswagen Group figure. Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution tons of CO 2 e 1,230,802 Scania and VWTB use an activity-based calculation method. MAN Truck & Bus uses a cost-based approach. Scania and MAN Truck & Bus use emission factors from the Global Logistics Emission Council (GLEC). VWTB uses emission factors from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program (PBGHGP). ClimatePartner calculates this datapoint for International. Category 5: Waste tons of CO 2 e \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The production sites\u00e2\u0080\u0099 emissions are included in the Volkswagen Group figure Category 6: Business travel tons of CO 2 e \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Included in the Volkswagen Group figure Category 7: Employee commuting tons of CO 2 e \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Included in the Volkswagen Group figure Category 8: Upstream leased assets tons of CO 2 e \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Included in the Volkswagen Group figure Category 9: Downstream transportation and distribution tons of CO 2 e \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Included in Scope 3 category 4 Upstream transportation and distribution Category 10: Processing of sold products tons of CO 2 e 151,500 Only rigids are included in the processing calculation. The emissions are estimated by assuming that the processing emissions per vehicle correspond to the production emissions per vehicle. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are divided by the total number of vehicles sold and then multiplied by the number of rigids sold. ClimatePartner calculates this datapoint for International. Category 11: Use of sold products tons of CO 2 e 342,519,213 Emissions from the use phase of the products sold comprise the largest part of the TRATON GROUP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emission inventory. The calculation of these emissions is divided into two methods depending on the product category. The first method applies to the trucks and buses product category, while the second method applies to the power solutions and external engines and motors product category. To calculate the emissions from trucks and buses, variables such as the number of vehicles, energy consumption, a well-to-wheel GHG emission factor and the distance driven are taken into account. Each brand applies the same general formula by multiplying the values. But due to differences in the product portfolio, each brand calculates the total emissions in an individual way with differently grouped vehicle classes. For drive solutions and external engines and motors, Scania and MAN Truck & Bus estimate total fuel consumption based on information from engine and motor experts and multiply it by a CO 2 emission factor. International and VWTB do not sell their own engines and motors and therefore do not calculate emissions for this product category. Category 12: End-of-life treatment of sold products tons of CO 2 e 622,842 End-of-life treatment of sold products = \u00ce\u00a3 (intensity factor (tons of CO 2 per vehicle group) * product sales volume). Scania and MAN Truck & Bus use a combined LCA model to estimate the CO 2 emissions for each vehicle group at the end of its life cycle. Only disassembly and transportation are taken into account here, not credits for recycling or energy recovery. This method is also used by VWTB and applied to sales volumes. ClimatePartner calculates this datapoint for International. Category 13: Downstream leased assets tons of CO 2 e \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Included in the Volkswagen Group figure Category 14: Franchises tons of CO 2 e 292,358 Scania and MAN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emissions from franchises are calculated on the basis of the average Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of a typical commercial site. ClimatePartner calculates this datapoint for International. VWTB does not have any commercial sites that fall within the scope of the ESRS. Category 15: Investments tons of CO 2 e 8,690 Scania calculates this datapoint in two steps. First, the investments are prioritized by relevance, and the ten most important investments are selected for evaluation. The Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are then calculated in proportion to Scania\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shareholdings in these companies. It is calculated as emissions * percentage held. The emission data needed comes from the companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 environmental reports or, if these are not available, from completed questionnaires sent to the companies. MAN Truck & Bus has fewer than ten investments and therefore includes all investments in the calculation. For International, this datapoint is calculated by ClimatePartner. VWTB does not provide any financial resources for external companies. Download MAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS Scope 3 category Unit 2024 Notes Category 1: Purchased goods and services tons of CO 2 e 1,129,132 For the calculation of Scope 3 a spend-based approach is used. This category\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CO 2 e emissions relate to the supply chain emissions of all goods and services purchased in the reporting year. They were calculated on the basis of the invoice volume in \u00e2\u0082\u00ac.

CO 2 e emissions are calculated using well-to-tank emission factors. Systems commissioned in the year are taken into account by calculating their lifetime emissions. The included divisions are new products from the Marine 4-Stroke, Power, Industries & Quest-One. Representative emission factors are used on region-specific level as well as on sector specific. Category 12: End-of-life treatment of sold products tons of CO 2 e 0 This approach is based on the assumption that MAN Energy Solutions products are almost 100% recyclable at their end of life. The CO 2 e emissions that arise from recycling are excluded by a cut-off-approach.

No Scope 3 GHG emission levels are available for the TRATON GROUP or MAN Energy Solutions for 2023 Biogenic Scope 3 GHG emissions at Group level Biogenic CO 2 is reported for Scope 3 category 11. The data is collected on the basis of the DCI, meaning that the reporting is initially focused on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The data on the biofuel proportion and average emission factors is taken from a representative generic database. Efforts are being made to expand the scope of reporting in the coming years to heavy commercial vehicles. In the reporting year, biogenic Scope 3 GHG emissions amounted to 9,653,769 tons of CO 2 . No reporting possible for 2023. Methodologies, assumptions and emission factors used to measure Scope 3 GHG emissions The Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Scope 3 inventory is calculated on an annual basis in accordance with the requirements of the internationally accepted GHG Protocol and the ESRS. This enables the success of the actions to be determined and other areas where action can be taken to be identified. The methodologies and assumptions used for the calculation are documented in the internal manual, and updated annually. The emission factors used to calculate Scope 3 GHG emissions are taken primarily from a representative generic database. Factors from other sources (for example GHG Protocol) are also used for individual Scope 3 categories. Material changes and their effect on the comparability of GHG emissions In its internal manual, the Volkswagen Group states how the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Scope 3 inventory is compiled and updated annually. Year-on-year comparability has already been established for the DCI in recent years. In addition, reference was made to significant changes in how the Scope 3 emissions inventory is complied. In the past, we disclosed changes in the extent of reporting (coverage), the calculation method or the calculation data basis for Scope 3 GHG emissions in comparison to the preceding annual report. The following material changes apply compared with last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reporting: Starting in 2024, the category 7 emissions are based on a calculation that takes into account the global number of employees (direct and indirect) of the Volkswagen Group and region-specific, external, generic parameters for the modal split (distribution of transport by means of transport), mode-specific emission factors, average commuting distances and working days. For categories 2, 8, and 13, the emission factors used have been revised with effect from the 2024 reporting year because the source of the previous emission factors is no longer available. With effect from the 2024 reporting year, the data for category 13 has been revised to exclude emissions for leased vehicles from Group production to avoid double counting, particularly with categories 1 and 11. With effect from the 2024 reporting year, the emission factors have been differentiated by region, where possible, for categories 3 and 5. Updated emission factors for fossil fuels are used to determine the emissions in category 11. The \u00e2\u0080\u009c Targets: Climate change \u00e2\u0080\u009d section explains the material changes in reporting compared with previous years and how these changes affect the outcome. The emissions from the supply chains are currently calculated primarily using secondary data and industry averages. Immaterial changes to this data are not specifically assessed in terms of their impact on the overall outcome. Reporting periods in the value chain The Upstream transportation and distribution (category 4), Downstream transportation and distribution (category 9) and Franchises (category 14) areas of the Group report figures from the previous reporting year. This is done for procedural reasons. If there are any relevant changes, these would be reported and transparently disclosed in the following year. Scope 3 GHG emissions based on specific activities in the value chain The vehicle model and therefore all materials integrated in a vehicle and their weight are based on the vehicle bill of materials, i.e., on primary data. There is primary data from Tier 1 suppliers for individual hotspot materials or components. The same will apply in future for the battery (cell) production processes required in EU Batteries Regulation Article 7. There is not yet any recognized or standardized method of indicating the proportion of these emissions. Neither an indication as a share of datapoints nor as a share of total GHG emissions is entirely meaningful, because, for example, the proportion of emissions from decarbonized hotspot parts is naturally decreasing. Total GHG emissions The total GHG emissions metrics are calculated from the sum of the total emissions of the Scope 1, 2 and 3 categories.

If such actions are introduced in the future, we plan to differentiate between technology-based and nature-based solutions. Technology-based solutions should be based on specific counting, weighing and measurement of the GHGs removed from the atmosphere; assumptions, methodologies and frameworks shall not be applied. Nature-based solutions, on the other hand, should be based on assumptions, methodologies and frameworks of major established standards in the carbon market, such as VERRA and Gold Standard. Metrics on GHG removal and storage No metrics on GHG removal or storage are reported, as no actions for removing and storing GHGs have yet been implemented in the Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own operations or in the value chain. Use of carbon credits In line with the hierarchy of actions set out in the transition plan, the offsetting projects enhance our decarbonization strategy and, as explained in the plan, are an important factor in achieving our decarbonization targets. A carbon-free energy supply is not currently possible for global energy requirements. Energy efficiency therefore remains an important basis for effective climate change mitigation and should always be the first lever. Ultimately, the remaining energy needs requirements be covered with as much carbon efficiency as possible (second priority lever). This involves reviewing innovative energy concepts, direct integration of renewable energies, and technological changes such as electrification. In the area of hard-to-abate emissions, the Volkswagen Group is considering using climate action projects to offset them, for example to achieve net CO 2 e-neutral production (third priority lever). Emissions are considered to be hard to abate if avoiding them is either not currently technically possible or would be disproportionately expensive and therefore not economically feasible. As part of the net CO 2 e-neutral transition, the Volkswagen Group continues to offset unavoidable emissions from the life cycle phases, such as from the supply chain or production, through climate action projects with high certification standards. These include the VCS, the Climate Community and Biodiversity Standards (CCB Standards) and the Gold Standard. In addition to external certification standards, offsetting projects for quality assurance are also assessed in accordance with our own criteria. The Volkswagen Group intends to continue to observe the highest quality and certification standards in carbon offsetting (carbon credits) to achieve the long-term climate targets. Role of carbon credits as part of the decarbonization strategy The carbon offsetting approach is used for all emission categories from Scope 1 to Scope 3. Once all actions to increase efficiency and reduce emissions as outlined in our transition plan have been implemented, we intend to offset particularly hard-to-abate emissions through carbon offset projects. This will affect less than 10% of emissions. This is based on the requirements of the SBTi. If carbon credits are used to achieve decarbonization targets, they are used to ensure net carbon-neutral delivery of the battery-electric vehicles. The only carbon credits we use are those that meet the standards of VERRA and Gold Standard. We did not use carbon credits from any other standards in the reporting year. Metrics on carbon credits As a general rule, the carbon credits used by the Volkswagen Group must meet the highest quality standards. For this reason, they are only acquired from certain project types and from appropriately prequalified companies. The Volkswagen Group only accepts certain issuing standards for the carbon credits themselves. The underlying projects are implemented in accordance with publicly verifiable and scientifically based methodologies. The results of these projects are verified by independent third parties. Each carbon credit used by the Volkswagen Group represents \u00e2\u0088\u00921 ton of CO 2 e. After purchase, the carbon credit is always transferred to Volkswagen Group accounts and only then used (usually at a later date).

However, there is not yet a certification standard for a binding net zero target. This means that there are also no specific targets for the removal and storage of GHG emissions. Nevertheless, the Volkswagen Group has set itself the goal of basing its carbon offsetting actions on the requirements of the SBTi and the GHG Protocol and to limit their share to below 10%. The company will abide by internationally recognized standards in carbon offsetting. Internal carbon pricing We do not currently use an internal carbon price in investment decisions. However, we apply an abatement cost approach to support strategic decisions and to calculate and prioritize decarbonization actions in production. This involves relating various GHG emissions to the net present value, resulting in a value in \u00e2\u0082\u00ac/tons of CO 2 e. This assessment produces an abatement cost curve, from savings per ton of CO 2 e (energy efficiency actions) to high costs per ton of CO 2 e (use of synthetic fuels). This abatement cost curve helps to prioritize actions and to estimate the total costs of target achievement. However, this approach is not yet used in individual investment decisions. 1 https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-and-climate-model/ 2 Neef, M., Dettmer, T., B\u00c3\u00a4uml, G. et al.

The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has scientifically reviewed and upgraded the ambition of Volkswagen Group\u2019s emissions reduction targets in production. Volkswagen's SBTi ambition level thus rises from \"below 2 degrees\" global warming to \"1.5 degrees\" for its scope 1 (internal operations) and scope 2 (energy supply) emissions. The initiative and the company are publishing this news on the eve of the worldwide Earth Day, on which Volkswagen is calling on its workforce for the second time to take part in the global Project1Hour. Around 670,000 employees worldwide can spend an hour coming up with climate protection ideas - for their own carbon footprint and that of their company. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) first assessed the Volkswagen Group's scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets in September 2020. According to SBTi\u2019s analysis, the plans at that time were in line with the Paris Climate Agreement's requirement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Less than two years later, the SBTi has now reassessed Volkswagen AG's revised scope 1 and 2 emissions targets and upgraded the ambition level to 1.5 degrees. Volkswagen's increased targets relate to its own production and its energy supply. Previously, total CO\u2082 emissions in manufacturing were to fall by 30 per cent from 2018 to 2030. The Group has now raised this target to 50 percent. Today, the company already obtains 96 per cent of its external electricity from renewable energy sources at its EU-sites. By next year, the company wants to break the 100 per cent mark in the EU. By 2030, the same target is planned for all locations outside China. With its stricter CO\u2082 reduction targets, the Group-wide production is also making a contribution to achieving Volkswagen AG's overall climate targets. By 2030, the company aims to emit 30 per cent less CO\u2082 on average per vehicle (passenger cars and light commercial vehicles) over the lifecycle than in 2018. In 2021, the Volkswagen Group made significant progress in reducing its CO\u2082 footprint. CO\u2082 emissions were reduced by 1.7 tonnes per newly produced vehicle across the Group. Apart from the supply of renewable energies, the main reasons are the electrification of the product portfolio and Volkswagen\u2019s support for the expansion of wind and solar parks in Europe. The good news about the Volkswagen Group's more ambitious science-based targets is published today on the website of the Science Based Targets initiative ( www.sciencebasedtargets.org ) - one day before the Earth Day. Last year, the Volkswagen Group participated in this worldwide day of action for nature with its own Project1Hour. Around 670,000 Group employees worldwide were given one hour of working time to collectively learn about climate change and develop CO\u2082 saving ideas for themselves or their company. Project1Hour is taking place for the second time. Employees who already participated last year can deepen their knowledge this year. The Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, Dr. Herbert Diess, commented on the SBTi\u2019s latest validation and the upcoming Project1Hour: \"Whether the earth warms by 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius by 2050 has a major impact on developments such as species extinction, droughts and rising sea levels. The Volkswagen Group is taking its responsibility to protect the world for future generations. That is why we are sharpening our own emissions reduction targets in production after less than two years. We are pleased that the Science Based Targets initiative recognises this.\u201d The Group is also working hard to become more sustainable in other areas, such as decarbonising its supply chains, recycling and electrifying its vehicles. \u201cHow successful we continue to be as a company in the fight against global warming is also up to each and every individual. That is why our Group-wide Project1Hour is especially close to my heart. Everyone can contribute with good ideas to help us gain even more momentum in climate protection\u201d, said Herbert Diess.

Melodie Michel Photo by Jarom\u00edr Kavan on Unsplash Volkswagen Group\u2019s carbon footprint increased by 17 million tonnes between 2022 and 2023 despite improvements in operational emissions and vehicle efficiency. Overall, the group reported almost 420 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in its latest sustainability report , up from just under 403 million tonnes in 2022. Reductions in Scope 1 (-10%) and Scope 2 (-7%) were not enough to offset the increase in Scope 3 emissions, which went from 396.39 to 413.95 million tonnes (up 4.4%). The company has a science-based target to cut absolute operational GHG emissions by 50.4% by 2030 (from a 2018 baseline), and has already managed a 33.7% decrease so far. But its Scope 3 goal relates only to GHG intensity: reducing the carbon footprint of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 30% per vehicle. From 2022 to 2023, Volkswagen managed to lower this carbon intensity from 47.8 to 47.3 tonnes of CO2 per vehicle \u2013 but commercial growth outweighed these emissions gains, with a 12% increase in total vehicle deliveries . Although its decarbonisation strategy is based mostly on reductions, the company purchased carbon credits to offset 9 million tonnes of CO2 in 2023. Source: Volkswagen Group 2023 sustainability report Volkswagen Group to revise sustainability governance in 2024 As part of its sustainability report, Volkswagen Group also suggested that changes are on the horizon in 2024. First, it plans to recalculate its baseline carbon footprint based on new factors, such as the availability of region-specific life cycle assessments for the China market, the use of company-specific cutting rates for steel and aluminium components in production (instead of generic data), new vehicle use phase calculation methods and the availability of specific data for the emissions of group franchises instead of generic figures. Additionally, Volkswagen says it began revising its sustainability governance structure and workflows in 2023 \u201cin light of new and upcoming regulatory requirements\u201d and expects to complete this process in 2024. The company appointed its first Group Chief Sustainability Officer, Dirk Voeste , last year. Volkswagen aims to be \u201da net carbon-neutral company by 2050\u201d, and will focus more than two-thirds (68%) of its investments in the next five years on digitisation and electrification.
