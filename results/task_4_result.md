As we transition from automotive manufacturer to mobility group, we are resetting our priorities with the NEW AUTO Group strategy and positioning ourselves for the future. We are keeping our aim of being a world-leading provider of sustainable mobility firmly in our sights and making the Group more focused, efficient, innovative, customer-oriented and sustainable, as well as systematically gearing it toward profitable growth. The NEW AUTO Group strategy defines the six key focus issues shown above for the area of sustainability and ESG in Group initiative 6. This Sustainability Report including nonfinancial report is structured in accordance with these. In addition, the Sustainability in the Group's DNA chapter provides a definition of sustainability for the Group and an insight into topics such as risk management, environmental management, stakeholder management and corporate citizenship. Highlights 2023 1 Decarbonization Access to 600,000 charging points in Europe By 2030, the whole dealer network's carbon footprint is to be decreased by at least 30%. Circular Economy More than 850,000 metric tons of CO\u2082 have been saved in net terms since 2017 through the Aluminum Closed Loop. In 2023, we processed 77,090 tools to make them suitable to return to use. People in the Transformation 14.3 million training hours in the Volkswagen Group 72 locations are certified in accordance with ISO 45001. Integrity and Compliance In 2023, more than 4,100 business partners were audited. 1,551 inquiries were processed at the compliance information point. Diversity 94% of managers have taken part in the Diversity Wins@Volkswagen program. Proportion of women in management worldwide and internationality of top management increased. Supply Chain and Human Rights 7,791 direct suppliers worldwide were trained on sustainability. Suppliers with a positive S rating account for 79% of revenue in the total procurement volume. 1 Further information on the figures on this page, such as definitions and scope, can be found in the relevant chapters. Table of Contents The Group's DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity and Compliance | Supply Chain and Human Rights Foreword GRI 2-22 Oliver Blume, Daniela Cavallo, Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG Chairwoman of the General and Group Works Council of Volkswagen AG Dear stakeholders and colleagues, Values create value. We in the Volkswagen Group remain true to this principle. It's an important compass for our actions. And this stance lets us sustainably create long-term added value. For our staff, for our customers, for our investors - and for society as a whole. As one of the world's largest industrial groups, we carry a special responsibility. We can make a dif- ference. We want to and will seize this opportunity. We think of sustainability holistically - in terms of nature, people, society and value-adding entrepreneurship. From the supply chain through our production to the delivery and use of our products. Our goal is to help to shape nature and society positively. That's ambitious. And it will take a great deal of work. At the same time, achieving this goal is an obligation - internally to our colleagues and externally to our customers, society and, in particular, future generations. Sustainability Strategy: Clear Goals, Clear Responsibility Sustainability is one of our top priorities. As a strategic field, we set ourselves clear goals and plans for sustainability - which are binding with clear responsibilities. The focus is on implementing our strategic measures. We also leverage the synergies in the Volkswagen Group here: All goals are systematically broken down into goals for the brands and Group companies. Management has personal responsibility for complying with these. Decarbonization: What Drives Us The Volkswagen Group is clearly committed to electric \u00admobility. Inspirational product innovations of recent weeks and months - such as the Audi Q6 e-tron, the VW ID.7, the Porsche Macan electric or the long wheelbase version of the ID. Buzz - show that e-mobility is synonymous with emotion and fascination. Our delivery figures confirm this trend too. In 2023, the Volkswagen Group delivered 771,100 all-electric vehicles. This is equivalent to a year-on-year rise of 34.7%. The share of deliveries accounted for by all-electric vehicles increased to 8.3%. 6 Table of Contents The Group's DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity and Compliance | Supply Chain and Human Rights A key lever for reducing emissions is production: Our aim is to reduce production-related CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 50.4% by 2030 compared with the base year 2018. The renowned Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) confirmed that our Group meets the requirements for contributing to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius with this objective for the production phase (Scope 1 and 2). SBTi has confirmed that the aim of reducing CO2 emissions by 30% in the use phase (Scope 3) is in line with limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius. This confirmation spurs us on. The Volkswagen Group is aiming to reduce the average CO2 emissions per vehicle (passenger cars and light commercial vehicles) over the entire life cycle by 30% by 2030 compared with 2018. Ramping up electric mobility and expanding renewable energies go hand in hand here. That's why we are supporting the construction of wind farms and solar parks on an industrial scale. New wind farms and solar parks are to be constructed in several regions of Europe by 2025. In Germany, for example, Volkswagen supported the construction of a solar plant with a total capacity of 170 million kWh a year. The plant in Tramm-\u00ad G\u00f6then in Mecklenburg in northeastern Germany is the largest of its kind in Germany with around 420,000 solar panels. The Team: Engine of the Transformation Employees are any company's most valuable asset. The Volkswagen Group is only as strong as the people who work for it. Particularly in times of skills shortages, employer attractiveness is vital for companies' future viability. Our sector's shift toward e-mobility but also toward new business models and digitalization brings with it considerable changes for many workers. Jobs are being realigned, and new fields of work are emerging, while others permanently disappear. We are managing and monitoring these changes in a sustainable and socially responsible manner in the interests of our colleagues. This is also very much intended to ensure corporate success. Because employer attractiveness GRI 2-22 has long been more than a question of salary. Talented individuals also assess potential employers on factors such as flexibility, work-life balance, diversity, social benefits and personal responsibility. What do these changes mean for the Volkswagen Group? The responsibility for \"people in the transformation\" is at the core of our current and future activities in human resources. The \"Transform to Tech\" Group People Strategy, which the Group Board of Management adopted in 2021, plays a key role. When it comes to training, the Volkswagen Group's focus is on training colleagues on future technologies. This includes closely supporting them in the transformation process. For example, Volkswagen specifically added courses on e-mobility to its professional training program with the aid of the Volkswagen Group Academy. Newly designed and innovative programs from our Health department look after our em- ployees' psychological safety during the transformation. And where major changes are planned in a factory or office, we have transformation offices on hand. They are intended to give people an outlook for the future and provide a clear direction for the change process in the transformation. Job security until 2029 at Volkswagen AG gives employees the support they need. Holistic Responsibility: The Supply Chain at a Glance In addition to responsibility for its own employees, the Volkswagen Group also has a global responsibility. The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which has been in force in Germany for more than a year, has a special role here. Focuses include protecting human rights and minimizing \u00adenvironmental risks - both topics the Volkswagen Group identifies with through and through. The Sustainability Procurement Network shares information between our brands and regions, which serves as a component in managing sustainability in our supply chains. More than 110 experts from five continents work together in the network. The network allows the identification of current developments and challenges in the regions of the world and enables joint solutions to be developed. This is crucial because Volkswagen has over 63,000 direct suppliers in more than 95 countries. 7 Table of Contents The Group's DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity and Compliance | Supply Chain and Human Rights Technology: The True Key to Sustainability The Volkswagen Group has been a technology company for many decades. This is expertise we will also use in sustainability because we believe that technology is the key to progress in the sustainability strategy. As the Volkswagen Group, we are one of the few companies in the world that is taking the strategic expansion of technology leadership in electric mobility fully into its own hands - from cell and battery research to the development and production of breathtaking electric vehicles. Since PowerCo was launched in July 2022, the battery company has already defined three sites (Salzgitter, Valencia and St. Thomas), introduced the concept of the unified cell, founded a joint venture with Umicore to produce cathodes and introduced activities to secure the supply of raw materials. We are also taking on the task of expanding the charging in- frastructure. By 2025, the Volkswagen Group wants to enable more than 40,000 fast-charging points in China, North America and Europe to be put into operation. GRI 2-22 The Volkswagen Group stands for tradition and for strong brands. For advancing developments and overcoming chal- lenges. Today, we are undergoing automotive history's greatest transformation: We want to enable sustainable mobility for generations. Sustainability is deeply rooted in the Volkswagen Group's identity. It is an integral part of our Group strategy. For 2024, we are providing important and targeted new impetus. The Volkswagen Group is aware of its role, importance and responsibility. Together, we will do everything we can to make our important contribution - with team spirit, fairness and passion.

The report is supplemented by a detailed description of the sustainability activities of our brands and regions and of the Volkswagen Group's corporate citizenship projects. Further information, particularly information relevant to ESG investors - for example, ESG KPIs - is available on the Group's corporate website and is not part of this report. www.volkswagen-group.com > ESG-Performance & Reporting For reporting year 2023, Volkswagen AG is issuing a non- financial statement at Company level and a nonfinancial Group declaration, which are being published together as a combined separate nonfinancial report within the meaning of German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB) sections 289b para. 3 and 315b para. 3. The nonfinancial report is drawn up in accordance with HGB section 315c, in conjunction with sections 289c through 289e. In line with the German CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG), this nonfinancial report concentrates on the focus issues necessary for an understanding of the Volkswagen Group's business development, overall performance and position as well as the Volkswagen Group's impact on nonfinancial aspects. We are again reporting on our climate protection activities in line with the requirements of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Furthermore, the GRI Standards are used as the framework for drawing up the nonfinancial report. In this Sustainability Report, Volkswagen systematically uses the GRI Standards (with reference) as the underlying structure for reporting on management approaches and the specific standard disclosures. The GRI Content Index has been separated from the 2023 Sustainability Report and can be found as a separate document in the Group portal: www.volkswagen-group.com > Reporting Volkswagen Group Sustainability Communication 2023 SUSTAINABILITY WEBSITE ADDITIONAL REPORT COMMUNICIATION including www.volkswagen-group.com www.volkswagen-group.com > ESG-Performance & Reporting > Press Releases www.volkswagen-group.com 2023 Nonfinancial > Sustainability Statement 9 Table of Contents The Group's DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity and Compliance | Supply Chain and Human Rights As a member of the United Nations Global Compact, we also continuously report how we are putting the Ten Principles into corporate practice. Our current progress report can be found on the UN Global Compact's website: United Nations Global Compact The strategy chapter and the six following chapters on focus issues in the report each consist of a text section plus a consolidated KPI table at the end of each chapter. References to disclosures outside the nonfinancial report are supplementary information and do not form part of this report. The following passages are also not part of the non- financial report: Volkswagen Group Sustainability Communication (pp. 3-4) Foreword (pp. 6-8) The German Corporate Governance Code - A Blueprint for Successful Corporate Governance (p. 15) Further Information; The Volkswagen Value Chain (p. 16) Making the Social and Environmental Impact of Our Actions\u00ad Measurable (p. 24) The information in this report relates to the Volkswagen Group as a whole. Where information relates to individual Group divisions only, this is clearly indicated in the text. Unless indicated otherwise, any information provided for the Group also applies to Volkswagen AG. In addition to Volkswagen AG, the Group includes all major subsidiaries inside and outside Germany that are directly or indirectly controlled by Volkswagen AG. In the financial data, our joint ventures in China are reported using the equity accounting method. However, they are included in full (100%) in volume-related data (sales, production and workforce) and in production-related environmentally relevant data. The management approaches described in this report (e.g., the environmental compliance management system) apply to all the Volkswagen Group's controlled companies. With our non-controlled companies - i.e., companies that are not controlled by a company of the Volkswagen Group as the majority owner - we work to the extent feasible and permitted by law toward implementation of the adjusted management approaches. The Chinese joint ventures are included in the information on the Volkswagen Group in the KPIs and the associated targets on the topics of reduction of the environmental impact of production (UEP), the decarbonization index (DCI), the Opinion Survey, the diversity index, training hours per employee, accident indices and accident figures. The risks of the Chinese market are \u00adassessed by Volkswagen China Investment Company Ltd. GRI 2-2,2-4,2-5 The KPIs presented in this report build on the indicators \u00adpresented in previous years. Any material changes to data collection or to measurement methods for our sustainability performance are explicitly disclosed by the respective KPIs. All figures shown in the report are rounded, so minor discrepancies may arise from addition of these amounts. Report Auditing EY GmbH & Co. KG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft conducted a voluntary, limited assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) on the combined separate nonfinancial report prepared in accordance with HGB sections 289b para. 3 and 315b para. 3 to verify that its disclosures comply with the relevant statutory requirements. Further information on the engagement can be found in the independent practitioner's report on a limited assurance engagement on the nonfinancial reporting. Disclosures in Connection with the Annual Financial Statements No material special items in connection with the diesel issue were recognized in fiscal year 2023. To hedge the currently known legal risks related to the diesel issue, the provisions for litigation and legal risks as of De- cember 31, 2023 include an amount of around \u20ac0.9 (1.4) billion, based on existing information and current assessments. I\u00adnsofar\u00ad as these can be adequately measured at this stage, contingent liabilities relating to the diesel issue were disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in an aggregate amount of \u20ac4.0 (4.2) billion, whereby \u20ac3.8 (3.6) billion of this amount results from lawsuits filed by investors in Germany. The provisions recognized, the contingent liabilities disclosed, and the other latent legal risks in the context of the diesel issue are in part subject to substantial estimation risks given the complexity of the individual relevant factors, the ongoing coordination with the authorities, and the fact that the fact-finding efforts have not yet been con- cluded. Should these legal or estimation risks materialize, this could result in further substantial financial charges. In particular, adjustment of the provisions recognized in light of knowledge acquired or events occurring in the future cannot be ruled out. The remaining provisions relate to a wide range of identifiable individual risks, price risks and contingent liabilities, which are factored in in the amount of their probable occur- rence. Depending on the jurisdiction concerned, risk provisions for any non-compliance with statutory emissions limits are also included.
