It is one of the most challenging foreign policy relationship that President Biden inherited from his predecessor. In his first press conference, President Biden said: \u201cThis is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21 st century and autocracies.\u201d He further said: \u201cWe have got to prove democracy works.\u201d To a large extent, the issues of friction have remained the same as those under Donald Trump. Against this background the paper analyzes the developments in the US-China relations under the Biden administration. While addressing the Congress, in his first speech to Congress, President Biden assured the maintenance of a strong US military presence in the Indo-Pacific and promised to boost technological development and trade. \u201cChina and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future.\u201d [i] It may be noted, the day President Biden assumed office, China imposed sanctions on the outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other 27 officials for their posture towards China. This was meant to intimidate the new government. [ii] President Joe Biden and Xi Jinping had the first virtual meeting on 16 November 2021. (Earlier, the leaders had spoken twice.) The meeting lasted for three and a half-hour. The two leaders discussed issues of trade, Taiwan and human rights. Both sides issued separate statements listing their concerns. There was no major outcome of the meeting nor was there any joint statement. [iii] Xi Jinping laid out three principles and four priority areas for the China-US relations. [iv] However, there were no similar statements from the US side. US-China trade friction marks a highly contested aspect of bilateral relations. While speaking to the United Steelworkers in May 2020, President Biden had said: \u201cI will use tariffs when they are needed, but the difference between me and Trump is that I will have a strategy-a plan \u2013to use those tariffs to win, not just to fake toughness\u201d. [v] The US new approach to the US-China bilateral trade relationship was articulated by US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai at the CSIS. [vi] Her remarks at CSIS indicated that the US is looking forward to assessing and discussing the \u201cPhase One\u201d trade agreement signed under Donald Trump in January 2020, launching a new review process to look at Section 301 tariffs on Chinese exports, to address China\u2019s \u201cstate-centred\u201d trade policies and practices, including what USTR deems to be trade-distorting industrial policies and to focus on working with allies and like-minded countries to address issues of mutual concern relating to China, and to shape the rules for fair trade to facilitate \u201ca race to the top\u201d for market economies. [vii] In addition, two meetings have also been held between the trade representative of the US and China but no breakthrough has been achieved so far. [viii] It may be recalled that on 14 February 2020, the US and China entered into the first phase of the trade agreement, the Economic and Trade Agreement between the US and the People\u2019s Republic of China. [ix] According to the agreement, China agreed to purchase certain US goods and services worth USD 200 billion for two years, starting from 1 January 2020 through 31 December 2021 with 2017 as the baseline year. According to a study by Chad P. Bown of Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), it is evident that China bought none of the items promised Source: Peterson Institute for International Economics [x] However, irrespective of the trade friction, China is the second-largest trading partner of the US after the European Union (EU). The total trade value between China and the US is USD 682.32 billion from January to November in 2021, a year-on-year increase of 30.2 per cent. [xi] China sells almost four times to the US. [xii] The Ambassador of China to the US has said that the \u201cChina-US economic and trade relations are win-win in nature\u201d. He also reiterated that closer economic cooperation between the US-China is not only crucial but also mutually beneficial as the two economies are interdependent. [xiii] . [xiv] As of now, officials from the US have asked for concrete actions from China to purchase US goods and services as under the \u201cPhase One\u201d trade deal. [xv] Overall, the Biden administration has continued protesting China\u2019s economic policies that led to the starting of the trade war. [xvi] President Biden banned 59 firms for their ties with China\u2019s military or surveillance industry, including Huawei Technology and other telecommunication companies. [xvii] On 16 December 2021, the Biden administration imposed trade restrictions on more than 30 Chinese research institutes and entities over human rights violations and alleged development of technologies, for example, brain-control weapons, that affect US national security. [xviii] The trade war has further percolated down to the issue of technology and has become the forefront of the US-China frictions. Under Donald Trump, the US had accused China of cyber theft of intellectual property, coerced IP transfers and unfair trade practices. The US had argued that if China could ban Google and Facebook from entering China, similarly the US can ban Huawei and ZTE . [xix] The Trump administration had tightened restrictions on Huawei by cutting its access to the US components and technology. [xx] This made China aware of the US approach. Xi Jinping has reiterated, \u201cTechnology innovation has become the main battleground in the global strategic game\u201d. Consequently, this has made the US more conscious and they are scrutinising Chinese technical investment more closely. [xxi] The trend has continued under President Biden. In November, the US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo included eight China-based technology entities to the Entity List \u201cto prevent US\u2019 emerging technologies from being used for the PRC\u2019s quantum computing efforts that support military applications\u201d. Subsequently, the US added 37 more entities to its Entity List to \u201cdeter misuse of biotechnology\u201d and other technologies \u201cfor military applications and human rights abuses\u201d. [xxii] Last year President Biden had signed Executive Order 14017 to assess the US vulnerabilities in the critical supply chain. Within six months, the administration came out with a complete comprehensive review of the supply chains for four critical products and established a Supply Chain Disruption Taskforce (SCDTF) to address the challenges arising from the pandemic. An annual report has also been published identifying their vulnerabilities and strategies. [xxiii] In addition, the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength Act of 2022 (the America COMPETES Act of 2022) was passed on 4 February 2022. The Act covers scientific research, economic competitiveness, and funding for the domestic production of semiconductors. It also contained a list of motions on the human rights situation in Xinjiang, a crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong and increasing tensions over Taiwan. [xxiv] The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian has criticised the act. He said the content in the bill regarding China has a \u201cCold-War mentality and zero-sum game mindset\u201d. [xxv] On Taiwan, President Biden\u2019s views were articulated through his two articles written in 2001 and 2020. In 2001, Joe Biden wrote an article in the Washington Post , \u201cNot so deft on Taiwan\u201d [xxvi] ; at this point he was critical of the US support to Taiwan and preferred to maintain strategic ambiguity. Before the US elections, in 2020 he wrote another article for New York-based Chinese-language newspaper World Journal [xxvii] , describing his vision towards the Taiwan issue and supporting the US stance towards Taiwan. In one year of his presidency, despite strong resentment from China, President Biden invited Taiwan to the Summit of Democracy. [xxviii] The Taiwanese Vice President Lai Ching-te met the Vice President of the US briefly during the inauguration of new Honduras President Xiomara Castro. It was the first public meeting between the two Vice-Presidents since they took office. [xxix] Until now the Biden administration has provided arms sales to Taiwan twice. First, on 5 August 2021, the Biden administration agreed to a USD 750 million weapons sale to Taiwan. Second, on 8 February 2022, arm sales worth USD 100 million worth of equipment and services to support its air and missile defence systems to Taiwan. Soon after taking office, President Biden started sending warnings to China against any expansion in East and Southeast Asia. He reiterated that the US position on China\u2019s maritime claims remains the same as the 2016 Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s finding. The US has also rejected aggressive Chinese postures, exploitation of hydrocarbon and fisheries in the South China Sea. [xxx] Periodically, the US has been sending naval and air patrols challenging China's claims of sovereignty over the area and also asserting the freedom of navigation. In the last few years, the US has conducted many Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOP); one in 2015, three in 2016, four in 2017, six in 2018, eight in 2019, and nine in 2020 . [xxxi] President Biden showed no sign of backing down. In the first month in office, he sent two aircraft carrier strike groups for joint operation in the disputed region. [xxxii] Conclusion In the virtual meeting with President Biden, Xi Jinping has reiterated that the most important event in international relations in the coming 50 years will be for China and the US to find the right way to get along. On the other hand, after the virtual summit, President Biden said: \u201cLet\u2019s get something straight, we know each other well. We\u2019re not old friends. It\u2019s pure business.\u201d The contradiction in their perception of bilateral relations is evident. A few developments such as the release of t he CFO of Huawei, Meng Wanzhou from jail have taken place. But largely, the technology issue between the two sides remains complex. At the moment, the trajectory of the trade war appears to be uncertain. This year marks the 50 th anniversary of Richard M. Nixon\u2019s visit to China and the signing of the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9. China is using the occasion to warn the US to refrain from using Taiwan as a \u201cpoker chip\u201d and to remind of its commitments made in the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis Taiwan. Two delegations from the US have visited Taiwan. One delegation led by former US Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and the second led by Mike Pompeo. In the ongoing Ukraine crisis, US-China relations are becoming tenser. China has criticised the US position on the crisis and the chances are that US-China ties will become more antagonistic. President Biden and his administration are attempting a nuanced policy on China. They are making efforts to keep all channels of communication in place and the policies under him are becoming more competitive. To sum up, US-China relations are at a critical juncture and the second year of his presidency will be crucial for bilatera l relations. ***** *Dr. Teshu Singh is a Research Fellow at the Indian Council of World Affairs, New Delhi Disclaimer: Views expressed are personal.

Biden, Jr. today held a Summit with President Xi Jinping of the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of China (PRC), in Woodside, California. The two leaders held a candid and constructive discussion on a range of bilateral and global issues including areas of potential cooperation and exchanged views on areas of difference. President Biden emphasized that the United States and China are in competition, noting that the United States would continue to invest in the sources of American strength at home and align with allies and partners around the world. He stressed that the United States would always stand up for its interests, its values, and its allies and partners. He reiterated that the world expects the United States and China to manage competition responsibly to prevent it from veering into conflict, confrontation, or a new Cold War. The two leaders made progress on a number of key issues. They welcomed the resumption of bilateral cooperation to combat global illicit drug manufacturing and trafficking, including synthetic drugs like fentanyl, and establishment of a working group for ongoing communication and law enforcement coordination on counternarcotics issues. President Biden stressed that this new step will advance the U.S. whole-of-government effort to counter the evolving threat of illicit synthetic drugs and to reduce the diversion of precursor chemicals and pill presses to drug cartels. The two leaders welcomed the resumption of high-level military-to-military communication, as well as the U.S.-China Defense Policy Coordination Talks and the U.S.-China Military Maritime Consultative Agreement meetings. Both sides are also resuming telephone conversations between theater commanders. The leaders affirmed the need to address the risks of advanced AI systems and improve AI safety through U.S.-China government talks. The two leaders exchanged views on key regional and global challenges. President Biden underscored the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 support for a free and open Indo-Pacific that is connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient. The President reaffirmed the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ironclad commitment to defending our Indo-Pacific allies. The President emphasized the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 enduring commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight, adherence to international law, maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea and East China Sea, and the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula . President Biden reaffirmed that the United States, alongside allies and partners, will continue to support Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense against Russian aggression, to ensure Ukraine emerges from this war as a democratic, independent, sovereign, and prosperous nation that can deter and defend itself against future aggression. Regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, the President reiterated U.S. support for Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to defend itself against terrorism and emphasized the importance of all countries using their influence to prevent escalation and expansion of the conflict. President Biden underscored the universality of human rights and the responsibility of all nations to respect their international human rights commitments. He raised concerns regarding PRC human rights abuses, including in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong. On Taiwan, President Biden emphasized that our one China policy has not changed and has been consistent across decades and administrations. He reiterated that the United States opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side, that we expect cross-strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, and that the world has an interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. He called for restraint in the PRC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait. President Biden also raised continued concerns about the PRC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfair trade policies, non-market economic practices, and punitive actions against U.S. firms, which harm American workers and families. The President emphasized that the United States will continue to take necessary actions to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine our own national security, without unduly limiting trade and investment. The President again emphasized that it remains a priority to resolve the cases of American citizens who are wrongfully detained or subject to exit bans in China. The two leaders reiterated the importance of ties between the people of the United States and the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of China, and committed to work towards a significant further increase in scheduled passenger flights early next year, in parallel with actions to restore full implementation of the U.S.-China air transportation agreement, to support exchanges between the two countries. The two leaders also encouraged the expansion of educational, student, youth, cultural, sports, and business exchanges. The two leaders underscored the importance of working together to accelerate efforts to tackle the climate crisis in this critical decade. They welcomed recent positive discussions between their respective special envoys for climate, including on national actions to reduce emissions in the 2020s, on common approaches toward a successful COP 28, and on operationalizing the Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s to accelerate concrete climate actions. President Biden stated that the United States stands ready to work together with the PRC to address transnational challenges, such as health security and debt and climate finance in developing countries and emerging markets. Building on the November 2022 meeting in Bali where they discussed the development of principles related to U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 China relations, the two leaders acknowledged the efforts of their respective teams to explore best practices for the relationship. They stressed the importance of responsibly managing competitive aspects of the relationship, preventing conflict, maintaining open lines of communication, cooperating on areas of shared interest, upholding the UN Charter, and all countries treating each other with respect and finding a way to live alongside each other peacefully. The leaders welcomed continued discussions in this regard. The two leaders agreed that their teams will follow-up on their discussions in San Francisco with continued high-level diplomacy and interactions, including visits in both directions and ongoing working-level consultations in key areas, including on commercial, economic, financial, Asia-Pacific, arms control and nonproliferation, maritime, export control enforcement, policy-planning, agriculture, and disability issues. ### Next Post: Remarks by President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden After a Welcome Reception for APEC Leaders | San Francisco, CA Remarks by President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden After a Welcome Reception for APEC Leaders | San Francisco, CA November 15, 2023 \u2022 Speeches and Remarks Next Post Home The Record The Issues Briefing Room The Administration Executive Offices The White House Espa\u00c3\u00b1ol Contact Us Privacy Policy Copyright Policy Accessibility Statement Instagram Opens in a new window Facebook Opens in a new window X Opens in a new window YouTube Opens in a new window Threads Opens in a new window Reddit The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 WH.gov Scroll to Top Scroll to Top Top",

Share full article The call between President Biden and President Xi Jinping of China on Thursday reflected the sense of urgency in the White House to compete with Beijing and establish policymaking expectations. Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times By Zolan Kanno-Youngs and David E. Sanger Published Sept. 10, 2021 Updated Nov. 16, 2021 \u9605\u8bfb\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u7248 \u95b1\u8b80\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\u7248 WASHINGTON \u2014 In their first conversation in seven months, President Biden spoke on Thursday with President Xi Jinping of China , expressing concern over China\u2019s cyberactivities while arguing that the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest economies could set aside their differences to work together on climate change. The call amounted to a break in what experts have called one of the lowest points in the relationship between the two countries in decades. It was only the second time that the leaders have spoken since Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration; the lack of communication is a measure of the rising tensions between their nations as they seek to maneuver to limit the global influence of the other. The call, which a senior administration official said lasted 90 minutes, came at a particularly delicate time. Tensions are growing over Taiwan and the South China Sea, and Mr. Biden is trying to rally the West in what he calls a battle between \u201cautocracy versus democracy.\u201d It also came less than two weeks after the United States completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan , where China has been interested in mining for commodities. Even as Mr. Biden\u2019s senior officials stressed the importance of engaging directly with Mr. Xi after months of stalled discussions, administration officials on Thursday evening gave remarkably few details from the call. Mr. Biden did push China to agree to a set of guardrails for policymaking while also emphasizing the need to mitigate climate change, officials said. The discussion \u201cwas part of the United States\u2019 ongoing effort to responsibly manage the competition between the United States and the P.R.C.,\u201d according to a White House statement, using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China. Mr. Biden \u201cunderscored the United States\u2019 enduring interest in peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and the world, and the two leaders discussed the responsibility of both countries to ensure competition does not veer into conflict.\u201d The official Chinese summary of the call said that Mr. Xi told Mr. Biden that the U.S. government\u2019s policies toward China had strained relations, and that it was in both countries\u2019 interests to avoid confrontation.

The two presidents had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on issues of strategic importance in China-U.S. relations and on major global and regional issues. President Xi pointed out the current state of China-U.S. relations is not in the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples, and is not what the international community expects. China and the United States need to have a sense of responsibility for history, for the world and for the people, explore the right way to get along with each other in the new era, put the relationship on the right course, and bring it back to the track of healthy and stable growth to the benefit of the two countries and the world as a whole. President Xi expounded on the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and its key outcomes. He pointed out that the domestic and foreign policies of the CPC and the Chinese government are open and transparent, with clearly stated and transparent strategic intentions and great continuity and stability. We are advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, basing our efforts on the goal of meeting people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aspirations for a better life, unswervingly pursuing reform and opening-up, and promoting the building of an open global economy. China remains firm in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace, always decides its position and attitude based on the merits of issues, and advocates resolving disputes peacefully through dialogue and consultation. China is committed to deepening and expanding global partnerships, safeguarding the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, and building a community with a shared future for mankind. China will stay committed to peaceful development, open development and win-win development, participate in and contribute to global development, and pursue common development with countries across the world. President Xi pointed out that the world is at a major inflection point in history. Countries need to both tackle unprecedented challenges and seize unprecedented opportunities. This is the larger context in which we should view and handle China-U.S. relations. China-U.S. relations should not be a zero-sum game where one side out-competes or thrives at the expense of the other. The successes of China and the United States are opportunities, not challenges, for each other. The world is big enough for the two countries to develop themselves and prosper together. The two sides should form a correct perception of each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s domestic and foreign policies and strategic intentions. China-U.S. interactions should be defined by dialogue and win-win cooperation, not confrontation and zero-sum competition. President Xi said that he takes very seriously President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfive-noes\u00e2\u0080\u009d statement. China does not seek to change the existing international order or interfere in the internal affairs of the United States, and has no intention to challenge or displace the United States. The two sides should respect each other, coexist in peace, pursue win-win cooperation, and work together to ensure that China-U.S. relations move forward on the right course without losing direction or speed, still less having a collision. Observing the basic norms of international relations and the three Sino-U.S. joint communiqu\u00c3\u00a9s is vitally important for the two sides to manage differences and disagreements and prevent confrontation and conflict; indeed, it is the most important guardrail and safety net for China-U.S. relations. President Xi gave a full account of the origin of the Taiwan question and China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principled position. He stressed that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations. Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese and China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal affair. It is the common aspiration of the Chinese people and nation to realize national reunification and safeguard territorial integrity. Anyone that seeks to split Taiwan from China will be violating the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation; the Chinese people will absolutely not let that happen! We hope to see, and are all along committed to, peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, but cross-Strait peace and stability and \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaiwan independence\u00e2\u0080\u009d are as irreconcilable as water and fire. We hope that the U.S. side will match its words with action and abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiqu\u00c3\u00a9s. President Biden has said on many occasions that the United States does not support \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaiwan independence\u00e2\u0080\u009d and has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to seek advantages in competition with China or to contain China. We hope that the U.S. side will act on this assurance to real effect.\u00e2\u0080\u0082 President Xi noted that freedom, democracy and human rights are the common pursuit of humanity and also the unwavering pursuit of the CPC. Just as the United States has American-style democracy, China has Chinese-style democracy; both fit their respective national conditions. The whole-process people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s democracy practiced in China is based on the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reality, history and culture, and it reflects people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will. We take great pride in it. No country has a perfect democratic system, and there is always a need for development and improvement. The specific differences between the two sides can be worked out through discussion, but only on the precondition of equality. The so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracy versus authoritarianism\u00e2\u0080\u009d narrative is not the defining feature of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world, still less does it represent the trend of the times. President Xi pointed out that the two countries take different paths; while the United States practices capitalism, China practices socialism. Such difference is nothing new and will continue to exist. Leadership of the CPC and China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s socialist system have the support of 1.4 billion people. They are the fundamental guarantee for China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development and stability. For China and the United States to get along, it is vital to recognize and respect such difference. Neither side should try to remold the other in one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own image, or seek to change or even subvert the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system. Instead of talking in one way and acting in another, the United States needs to honor its commitments with concrete action. President Xi underscored that China and the United States are two major countries with different histories, cultures, social systems and development paths. There have been and will continue to be differences between the two countries. Such differences should not become an obstacle to growing China-U.S. relations. There is always competition in the world, but competition should be about learning from each other to become one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better self and make progress together, not about taking others down in a zero-sum game. The Chinese nation has the proud tradition of standing up for itself. Suppression and containment will only strengthen the will and boost the morale of the Chinese people. Starting a trade war or a technology war, building walls and barriers, and pushing for decoupling and severing supply chains run counter to the principles of market economy and undermine international trade rules. Such attempts serve no one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests. We oppose politicizing and weaponizing economic and trade ties as well as exchanges in science and technology. Under the current circumstances, China and the United States share more, not less, common interests. It is in our mutual and fundamental interest to prevent conflict and confrontation and achieve peaceful coexistence. The two economies are deeply integrated, and both face new tasks in development. It is in our mutual interest to benefit from each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development. It is also in our mutual interest to promote post-COVID global recovery, tackle climate change and resolve regional issues through China-U.S. coordination and cooperation. The two sides need to respect each other, pursue mutual benefit, focus on the larger picture, and nurture a sound atmosphere and stable relations for cooperation. President Biden noted that he has known President Xi for many years and maintained regular communication, but nothing could substitute for the kind of face-to-face meeting today. President Biden congratulated President Xi on his re-election as General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee. As two major countries, the United States and China have a responsibility to keep a constructive relationship. The U.S. side is committed to keeping the channels of communication open between the two presidents and at all levels of government, so as to allow candid conversations on issues where the two sides disagree, and to strengthen necessary cooperation and play a key role in addressing climate change, food security and other important global challenges. This is vitally important to the two countries and peoples, and also very important to the whole world. President Biden reaffirmed that a stable and prosperous China is good for the United States and the world. The United States respects China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system, and does not seek to change it. The United States does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to revitalize alliances against China, does not support \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaiwan independence\u00e2\u0080\u009d, does not support \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo Chinas\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cone China, one Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and has no intention to have a conflict with China. The U.S. side has no intention to seek \u00e2\u0080\u009cde-coupling\u00e2\u0080\u009d from China, to halt China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic development, or to contain China. President Biden said that how the U.S-China relationship develops is of crucial importance to the future of the world. The United States and China have a shared responsibility to show the world that they can manage their differences, and avoid and prevent misunderstandings and misperceptions or fierce competition from veering into confrontation or conflict. The U.S. side shares the view that it is necessary to work out the principles guiding U.S.-China relations. The two teams may continue discussions on the basis of the common understandings already in place, and strive for early agreement. The U.S. government is committed to the one-China policy. It does not seek to use the Taiwan question as a tool to contain China, and hopes to see peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The two presidents agreed that their respective diplomatic teams should maintain strategic communication and conduct regular consultations; their financial teams will continue dialogue and coordination on macroeconomic policies, economic ties and trade; and the two countries will jointly work for the success of the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The two sides reached common understandings on conducting dialogue and cooperation in public health, agriculture and food security. They agreed to make good use of the China-U.S. joint working group to promote the resolution of more issues. They also agreed that people-to-people exchange is very important, and agreed to encourage the expansion of such exchange in all sectors. The two presidents also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis and other issues. President Xi pointed out that China is highly concerned about the current situation in Ukraine. He noted the four points about what must be done he had proposed soon after the outbreak of the crisis and the four things the international community must do together he had suggested recently. Facing a global, composite crisis like the one in Ukraine, it is important to give serious thought to the following: first, conflicts and wars produce no winner; second, there is no simple solution to a complex issue; and third, confrontation between major countries must be avoided. China has all along stood on the side of peace and will continue to encourage peace talks. We support and look forward to a resumption of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. At the same time, we hope that the United States, NATO and the EU will conduct comprehensive dialogues with Russia. Both presidents viewed the meeting as in-depth, candid and constructive. They instructed their teams to promptly follow up and implement the important common understandings reached between them, and take concrete actions to put China-U.S. relations back on the track of steady development. The two presidents agreed to maintain regular contact. Ding Xuexiang, Wang Yi and He Lifeng, among others, were present at the meeting.

SULLIVAN: Good evening. As I said at the very start of these meetings, President Biden has been clear that he is committed to managing this important relationship responsibly. Our aim in every engagement with China is to deliver for the American people. Under President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership, the United States has and will continue to advance its interests and values, look out for its friends. And as we do, we believe that competition with China does not have to lead to conflict or confrontation. The key is responsible management through diplomacy. Beginning in May of last year, that diplomacy has been an all-hands-on-deck effort across the U.S. government and the Cabinet, which has included four meetings between myself and Director Wang Yi, as well as engagements between Secretary Blinken, Secretary Yellen, Secretary Raimondo and their counterparts, and many other Cabinet secretaries and their counterparts. Those discussions helped lay the foundation for a productive summit between President Biden and President Xi in San Francisco at the end of last year. There, our leaders agreed on concrete steps on issues that matter to the American people and, for that matter, matter to the world. This week, I traveled to China for the first time as National Security Advisor to take stock of where we have made progress and what work there still remains to be done, and also how we can responsibly manage the difficult issues and the differences that we have in this relationship. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the focus of my meetings with President Xi, with Director and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and with CMC Vice Chairman Zhang Zouxia [sic] \u2014 excuse me, Zhang Youxia. This was a true working visit. Over the course of 14 hours of meetings, we discussed progress and next steps on implementation of the Woodside commitments, including our work on counternarcotics and efforts to reduce the flow of illicit synthetic drugs into the United States; military-to-military communications including an upcoming engagement between our theater commanders; as well as work towards another round of AI safety and risk talks. Among other issues of global concern, we discussed the recent efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. These meetings were also about managing tough issues, as I said, and areas of disagreement. And I was direct on these issues as well. The United States will continue to take necessary action to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine our national security without unduly limiting trade or investment. We have continued concerns about China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfair trade policies and non-market economic practices. We remain deeply concerned about China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support for Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense industrial base and its impact on both European and transatlantic security, not to mention on Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brutal aggression against Ukraine. It is a top priority for this administration to resolve the cases of American citizens who are wrongfully detained or subject to exit bans in China. And this was another opportunity for me to raise those cases, as I have done in my prior engagements. I also underscored the longstanding U.S. commitment to universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. In all of my meetings, I stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait; emphasized the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula; and I reaffirmed the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 commitment to our Indo-Pacific allies including our concerns about destabilizing actions against lawful Philippine maritime operations in the South China Sea. These were constructive, candid, substantive conversations. We believe that keeping lines of communication open is critical. And to that end, we began planning towards a leader-level call in the coming weeks where I expect these discussions to continue. And with that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be happy take your questions. Yeah. Q Throughout your meetings with Chinese officials, including Xi Jinping, did you get a sense of how Chinese leadership is feeling about the race for the White House? Obviously, the election would be a looming issue for them. MR. SULLIVAN: I didn\u2019t really get a feeling for that. We didn\u2019t discuss the American election. That\u2019s obviously something for the American people to decide and not for any other country to get involved in. So, neither in my meetings with Director Wang nor in the meeting with the President, or, for that matter, with the CMC Vice Chair, did we specifically talk about the American election. Yeah. Q Hi there. Marc Stewart from CNN. As you mentioned, you talked about some of the maritime issues. I don\u2019t have to tell you, obviously, things are very tense right now in the South China Sea, especially with the Philippines and some of these reef issues. Reading the readout, it said you discussed some of this with Xi Jinping himself. Other than diplomatic speak, is there a reasonable roadmap or blueprint for the future? Because I think that the level of tension is reaching an extremely high level. MR. SULLIVAN: So, first, we believe that the order of the day should be de-escalation, and we support direct discussions between the Philippines and the PRC to that end. We also have made very clear that our mutual defense treaty applies to public vessels, including coast guard vessels, that are operating in the South China Sea and in other waters. It also applies to aircraft, for that matter. So the PRC well understands the longstanding commitment the United States has under its mutual defense treaty to the Philippines, and the Philippines well understands that we have an ironclad commitment to support them in their lawful exercise of their rights, their maritime rights. At the same time, nobody is looking for a crisis \u2014 not the Philippines, not the United States, and we hope not the PRC. But I did raise our concerns about some of the destabilizing actions that have taken place, including the ramming of coast guard vessels and unsafe intercepts near Scarborough Shoal. It\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue to discuss with our Chinese counterparts. It\u2019s something we will continue to consult closely with our Filipino counterparts on. And in fact, before I came here, I had the opportunity to call my Filipino counterpart, the National Security Advisor, Secretary A\u00c3\u00b1o, and I will stay in close touch with him, as will other members of the U.S. government. So we will do our best to try to contribute to managing this issue in a responsible way so that de-escalation is the order of the day. Yeah. Q Hello. This is Rae (ph) from The Paper. So, I wonder, since the San Francisco summit, you know, more than 20 communication mechanisms have been established or assumed, maintaining the momentum from (inaudible) dialogue between the two countries. So following this visit, what will be the key focus of the U.S. diplomacy towards China through next January? And what specific interim achievement does the Biden administration hope to secure during this period? Thank you. MR. SULLIVAN: Well, first, at a macro level, the most important thing and a core part of my extended engagement with Director Wang, not just here but in multiple meetings dating back to the beginning of last year, is overall responsible management of this relationship so the competition doesn\u2019t veer into confrontation or conflict. That is ongoing work. And being able to reach the end of President Biden\u2019s administration with the relationship on a stable basis, even though we have areas of difference and areas of difficulty, this is something we will work towards. More specifically, we\u2019re going to look for further progress on counternarcotics and reducing the flow of illicit synthetic drugs into the United States. We are going to look for a deepening of the military-to-military communication so that we can pass that on to President Biden\u2019s successor. And, in fact, a very positive outcome of the sessions here is that there will be a call between the theater commanders, the INDOPACOM commander and the Southern Theater commander for the PLA. Having the opportunity today to sit down with the CMC Vice Chairman, something that has not happened for a U.S. official in eight years, is itself significant because it allows us to give impetus and momentum to those military-to-military lines of communication, and that will be an important priority for us as we go forward. There are other issues as well, of course, that we\u2019ll deal with, and we\u2019ll have to manage the risks and flashpoints too: cross-Strait relations, the South China Sea, the Chinese support for the Russian defense industrial base. And we\u2019ll continue to work on all of those in the months ahead. Yeah. Q Welcome to Beijing. My name is Laura Baker. I\u2019m from BBC News. I\u2019d like to ask you: You talk about a call between the two leaders within the coming weeks. Will there be a last meeting between President Biden and President Xi? And also, back to those talks with General Zhang: How important is it for you to have those talks with a leading general? And what was the tone of those talks? MR. SULLIVAN: It is likely that both President Biden and President Xi will be at APEC and the G20 later this year. I don\u2019t have any announcements to make on either President Biden\u2019s travel or a potential meeting, but the likelihood is they\u2019ll both be there, and if they are, it would only be natural for them to have the chance to sit down with one another. So we\u2019ll have to await any confirmation or any announcements, but I think things pointing in that direction seem logical and reasonable. I think the meeting with Vice Chairman Zhang was very important. There is no substitute for actually being able to sit across the table, not just with the Vice Chairman but with his whole team, and be able to hear from them their perspective on critical issues, and them be able to hear from us our perspective on those same issues, whether it\u2019s cross-Strait relations or the South China Sea or cyber issues. And being able to have that exchange, which is rare, I think allows us to clarify our intentions and our concerns and hear theirs, and try to use that in service of responsible management of the relationship going forward. Yeah. Q Thank you. From the Wall Street Journal. Just to follow up on the question about the U.S. election, I\u2019m curious about what questions, if any, did the Chinese ask you about what a potential Harris administration would represent for U.S.-China relations. And connected to this, did you raise the issue specifically of potential election interference by China during your trip here today? MR. SULLIVAN: Every time I meet with Chinese officials, I raise the issue of election interference and laying down a clear marker that it\u2019s unacceptable for any nation to interfere in the U.S. election. And this trip was no different in that regard. I made that point once again. I won\u2019t characterize what the PRC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questions were with respect to Vice President Harris. They\u2019ll have to speak for themselves on that. But what I will say is that Vice President Harris has been a central member of the Biden foreign policy team, a leading member, and has been part of the design and execution of the overall strategy in the Indo-Pacific and with respect to the responsible management of U.S.-China relations. She has had the opportunity to engage herself with President Xi and with Premier Li. So she is known to both of the top leaders in China. And she shares President Biden\u2019s view that responsibly managing this competition, so it doesn\u2019t veer into conflict or confrontation, is essential. And she also shares the view that maintaining high-level, open lines of communication is the way that you can achieve that responsible management. So I was able to share my experience and my perspective of working closely with the Vice President and the role that she has played over the course of the past four years. Yeah. Q Thank you. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m with Phoenix TV. The Biden administration has announced arms sale to Taiwan 15 times now since taking office and surpassing the Trump administration\u2019s 11 times. So, China believes that the continued U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and other actions have increased tensions in the Taiwan Strait. So how do you respond to this? And what is the U.S. willing to do to de-escalate? Thank you. MR. SULLIVAN: Our One China policy has not changed, and our approach to this issue is guided by the One China policy, the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9s, and the Six Assurances. That remains true today, and that has remained true on a bipartisan basis through multiple administrations. And that policy has actually helped contribute to maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait for decades, and we intend to keep it that way. Let\u2019s see. Yeah. Q Ken Moritsugu with the AP. I want to ask about the 100 percent tariff that the Canadian government put on Chinese EVs earlier this week. It was reported that you had met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and encouraged Canada to go forward with that. Did that come up at all during these talks? Did the Chinese side complain about it or the timing? And if so, how did you respond? MR. SULLIVAN: First of all, Canada is a sovereign country that makes its own sovereign decisions, and it would be quite an extraordinary power to show up on a Sunday evening and produce a major trade policy move on a Monday morning. So, I think the right way to look at this is: I was there for a pre-scheduled cabinet retreat to speak with them. They took independent action. It was not at my behest or anything that I did or said that made that happen. That was a determination that they made. I did make the point while I was in Canada, and I\u2019d make it standing here today, that we have concerns relative to EVs, both with respect to security issues and overcapacity issues. We\u2019ve been public and transparent about that. But this was a decision they took on their own, and I won\u2019t characterize the conversations with the PRC on this issue; I\u2019ll let them speak for themselves. Yeah. Q Janis Mackey Frayer with NBC. A follow-up to the election-related question from Brian. The Chinese leadership and Chinese officials are about stability and consistency in their relationships. Did they at all signal to you any hesitation, nervousness, or concern about an upcoming change of administration at the White House? MR. SULLIVAN: They recognize that elections are sensitive periods and transitions are sensitive periods, and responsible management through an election and transition is important. That\u2019s something we believe as well. And my visit here during this period helps contribute to try and sustain that responsible management over this coming sensitive period. I will refrain from commenting on their perspective about what comes next. I think that\u2019s something that they\u2019re going to have to speak for themselves on. Yeah. Q Thanks. Trevor Hunnicutt, Reuters. Jake, could you talk a little bit about the status of the Middle East hostage and ceasefire negotiations? MR. SULLIVAN: I could, but it\u2019s moving hour by hour, and I haven\u2019t gotten an update in the last several hours. What I would say is that the negotiators are bearing down on the details, meaning that we have advanced the discussions to a point where it\u2019s in the nitty-gritty. And that is a positive sign of progress, but at the end of the day, nothing is done until it\u2019s done, and so we\u2019re just going to keep working at this until we finally get the ceasefire and hostage deal across the line. And I\u2019ll have the chance, when I get on the plane, to check in with our negotiating team who\u2019s participating in these talks in the region even as we speak. Yeah. Q Thank you. Evelyn Cheng from CNBC. On the issue of tech restrictions, I know that\u2019s something that the U.S. side has remained very firm on and that the Chinese side has repeatedly asked for changes on. If the trajectory is still going to be more restrictions, was there \u2014 you know, can you give some more details on what that discussion looked like? And then, just on the aspect of cross-Strait tensions and southeast \u2014 South China Sea, was there any specifics on what would look \u2014 what a de-escalation might look like? Thank you. MR. SULLIVAN: We had extended discussions about economics and national security, and I won\u2019t characterize the PRC position on that, other than to say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it was consistent in the room with what they have said publicly on the issue. For our part, I laid out our approach, which is rooted in the concept of small yard, high fence. I explained why it is that we feel we have to take some targeted restrictions to ensure that advanced technologies aren\u2019t used against U.S. national security. I explained that our approach is one of de-risking, not decoupling, and described in some detail how we saw de-risking in practice. And I also raised our concerns about steps that the PRC has taken with respect to the intersection of economics and national security and the impact that that has had on Western businesses and on supply chains. And so, we had a vigorous give-and-take on the issue. Obviously, we didn\u2019t come to agreement on certain aspects of things. But I think the dialogue is very useful because it clarifies the concerns of each side and also gives us the opportunity to explain what it is that we are doing and what we are not doing. And I thought that was valuable. We didn\u2019t reach any specific agreements on the South China Sea. You know, for one thing, it\u2019s not for the United States to reach agreements with China over the heads of parties like the Philippines. For another, you know, there\u2019s no substitute for that direct diplomacy between the two of them. But we did indicate and reiterate our longstanding commitment to our ally and our longstanding commitment to the rule of law, freedom of navigation, and the free exercise of maritime rights in the South China Sea. And we\u2019ll continue to do that. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take one more question. Yeah. Q China Media Group speaking. Sir, we noticed that almost all of your accompanying staff can speak Chinese. Do you think this helped you to communicate with your Chinese counterparts? And does this help you accurately understand China\u2019s core concerns? Thank you. MR. SULLIVAN: Yes. (Laughter.) The answer is yes. No, having a team here, many of whom do speak fluent Mandarin, have deep experience on issues related to the PRC and the U.S.-China relationship, this is \u2014 you know, it makes my job a heck of a lot easier and makes me much better than I would otherwise be. And I stand on the shoulders of those experts because, you know, they\u2019re the ones with the insights and the wisdom that drives forward the conversations that we\u2019ve had here over the last three days. So \u2014 All right, we\u2019ll do two more. Yeah. Q Yes. Keith Bradsher for the New York Times. Have you made any progress with China in discussing what might be a possible resolution for the war in Ukraine? Thank you. MR. SULLIVAN: I can\u2019t say that we did make progress on that issue. The PRC has been very public in its view that the war should end through diplomacy. They\u2019ve laid out various principles, both unilaterally and in separate communication with the Brazilians. We had the opportunity to exchange views on the war against Ukraine over the course of the last three days. We didn\u2019t reach any particular plan with respect to diplomacy, in large part because the United States very rigorously adheres to the simple maxim of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So, ultimately, it will be up to Ukraine to decide how it wants to proceed with diplomacy and negotiations. Yeah. Q (Inaudible.) Perhaps an overarching question. Several months ago, Chinese/Sino-U.S. relations was very intense, especially around the time U.S. imposed kind of additional tariff on Chinese EVs or semiconductors. And China is facing this trade war nowadays with Europe. But all of a sudden, you came and U.S.-China relations seems to be on better track, especially for the last few months of this year. What\u2019s behind this change? Does that have anything to do with Vice President Harris taking over the presidential race or any other factor from the Chinese side? And looking forward, do you see U.S.-China relations turning marginally for the better for the next few months, or potentially next few years, compared to a potential second Trump term? Thanks. MR. SULLIVAN: I can\u2019t characterize the Chinese side on this issue. They\u2019re going to have to speak for themselves. What I can tell you is that we believe, in the Biden administration, that intense diplomacy matters \u2014 because it doesn\u2019t resolve every issue, it doesn\u2019t mean that we are going to agree on everything, but it does mean that we can improve understanding, we can clarify misperceptions, we can reduce the risk of miscalculation, and we can identify areas to work together where our interests align that might previously have been hidden. So, the relationship remains a competitive relationship. We need to responsibly manage that competition, and we\u2019re doing that through this very detailed, painstaking, multiple rounds of diplomatic effort. And it\u2019s not to arrive at a certain end result where everything is just resolved. It\u2019s rather to arrive on a stable basis so that each of us can stand up for our interests, we can stand up for our friends, we can defend our values, we can take the actions we feel we need to take in service of our national interests, but we can also work together to ensure that the relationship is managed responsibly. That is what this trip was about. That\u2019s what the diplomacy of the last two years have been about. And we do believe that it puts us in a position to increase the prospect of stability in the relationship. But we have to keep in mind, too, that there are always risks \u2014 risks of escalation, risks of misunderstanding, risks of something going awry. And we\u2019ve seen that before in the U.S.-China relationship. And we discussed those risks, too, at some length, whether it\u2019s to do with cross-Strait relations or the South China Sea, or European security and the war in Ukraine, or many other issues, including issues that were not previously foreseen, like incidents from a year or two ago. So this is something we will have to keep working at, and it\u2019s a work in progress. Today is not the end of anything. It\u2019s just the continuation of a sustained pattern of intensive diplomacy led by President Biden and President Xi and carried out by many of us across our administration and the Chinese government, and we\u2019re going to keep at it. Thank you, guys.

It's an important part of U.S. quest for a phased de-escalation of U.S.-China tension, but it also merits close attention in its own right, bearing in mind the complex nature of U.S.-China competition over the long term. \u201cNot seeking to change the Chinese system\u201d is another important policy adjustment after the U.S. abandoned its so-called engagement policy. Since the normalization of U.S.-China relations, the primary logic underpinning the U.S. approach has long been \u201cchanging China through engagement.\u201d Under Donald Trump, the U.S. strategic community arrived at the prevailing view that the engagement policy had failed and replaced it with a strategy defined by competition. The Biden administration generally inherited Trump\u2019s policy shift, and even made further interpretations along the same lines. For example, Sullivan asserted at the Brookings Institution and on other occasions that it was not the policy goal of the Biden administration to fundamentally transform the Chinese system. Rather, the goal of U.S. policy toward China was to create an \"environment in which the two powers can operate in the international system.\u201d This suggests the Biden administration has not only turned away from the strategic approach of engagement with China but also the strategic goal of changing China. It\u2019s a fundamental reversal of U.S. policy toward China over four decades. Click here to read the latest issue of China-US Focus Digest In essence, the U.S. policy shift is driven by two main factors: First, China has become more proactive against the U.S. in recent years, which has led the U.S. to reckon that it is beyond its ability to change China. Since the start of the Trump administration, the U.S. has resorted to trade wars, technology wars and political wars, among other tactics in an attempt to force China to make concessions to the U.S. and to contain China\u2019s rise. But China has not only stood up against U.S. pressure but has steadily advanced its established policy guidelines and thrived in its national development. It has also gained experience and confidence in the intense competition with the United States and has taken a more proactive role in shaping China-U.S. relations. Through the course of high-level dialogues since Biden took office, China has been \u201cpursuing diplomacy on equal footing\u201d and proposed two lists and three bottom lines to the United States, including the basic principle that the United States must not challenge, defame or even attempt to subvert the socialist path and system with Chinese characteristics. Considering that the gap between the U.S. and a stronger China has narrowed, the statement that Washington does not seek to change Chinese system is a necessary response. Second, the U.S. statement is largely meant to ease tensions in bilateral ties. Relations have been in a downward spiral as a result of the Biden administration\u2019s policy of containing China and the continuous U.S. provocations related to Taiwan \u2014 a bottom-line issue for China. In response, China has faced down U.S. provocations relentlessly to defend its national interests. The Biden administration has gradually come to see the peril of continued deterioration in U.S.-China relations, and therefore intends to prevent a meltdown while pressing ahead with comprehensive containment. To this end, Biden has clarified the policy of \u201cnot seeking to change the Chinese system\u201d in hope of maneuvering a detente as part of its strategic crisis management and set the stage for summit meetings and the resumption of communication in various fields. The easing of U.S.-China relations will undoubtedly help the Biden administration focus on domestic issues, prepare for the 2022 midterm elections and seek China\u2019s cooperation on issues such as curbing inflation, stabilizing supply chains and implementing a new climate policy. It is clear that the statement arises out of a strong desire to serve Biden\u2019s domestic political agenda. It is important to note that while the statement about \u201cnot seeking to change the Chinese system\u201d does have some positive implications, it is still too early to tell whether it represents a long-term shift in the U.S. policy trajectory or is merely a tactical plot by the Biden administration. In particular, the Republican Party is not on board with Biden administration\u2019s detente with China, and voices clamoring for fundamental subversion of the Chinese system are not a rarity. More important, whether or not the statement indicates the prospect of a changed approach to pressure China remains to be seen. It has been a longtime tactic used by the U.S. to show a velvet hand but punch with an iron fist from behind. Sullivan\u2019s statement at Brookings suggests that the U.S. intends to focus on creating an international system that isolates China and indirectly forces China to make changes through systemic pressure. A series of major U.S. policy announcements already bear this out, including the upcoming Summit for Democracy in December, the Indo-Pacific economic framework in the making and the domestic infrastructure rebuilding initiative. With the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy and other important documents to be released at the end of this year and early next year, a new wave of offensives against China may be just around the corner.

The trade war, the pandemic, growing technology competition, rising tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, and contrasting approaches to the Russia-Ukraine conflict have collectively fed a sense of fatalism that the countries were heading toward the abyss of outright economic decoupling and a disastrous military conflict. The summit meeting between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping held in November near San Francisco, just in advance of the APEC Economic Leaders\u2019 Week, was the culmination of a year-long process that calmed the waters. The two sides announced a range of deliverables on economic and security issues and tried to convey a sense that they could effectively manage their differences. Although the United States and China are still engaged in a comprehensive contest for power and over setting the global rules of the game, guardrails are gradually being created, and as a result, the likelihood of the most disastrous outcomes has receded. Moreover, even though the chances of a genuine thaw that resolves fundamental differences and leads to greater cooperation are low, there also are underappreciated sources of structural stability that could keep relations from further deteriorating in the coming years. Nevertheless, it will take active diplomacy and some good luck to keep ties from fraying in 2024. Surpassing Low Expectations During their four-hour meeting on the Filoli Estate in Woodside, California, both Biden and Xi appeared to stick to their original positions on technology and economic security, Taiwan, Ukraine, human rights, and several other issues. At the same time, they were able to produce a series of deliverables exceeding the expectations of most analysts. Based on the readouts from the White House and People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) media ( Xinhua , Caixin ), it appears that, at a minimum, the two sides agreed to several actions: Resume military-to-military dialogue through a variety of channels and on a number of specific topics. Commit to accelerate efforts to expand renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions, including from methane and other greenhouse gases, in accordance with the joint statement issued at Sunnylands just before the bilateral meeting. Restore and expand cooperation on countering the production and trafficking of fentanyl and other narcotics. Step up discussions to minimize risks related to artificial intelligence. Push for more direct flights between the two countries and expand people-to-people exchanges. Begin consultations aimed at renewing the U.S.-China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement, which is set to expire in late February 2024. Beyond specific actions, the two sides adjusted the tone of how they frame the relationship. The Biden administration\u2019s readout said the two sides \u201care in competition,\u201d dropping the previously ubiquitous adjective \u201cstrategic\u201d from the characterization of ties. U.S. officials have continued to avoid using the \u201cs\u201d word in public statements . In place of the highly critical language about the United States and the Biden administration that have been dominant in the past few years, Chinese state media coverage has consistently highlighted the friendly and respectful nature of the meeting and has presented a hopeful vision for future ties. Chinese ambassador Xie Feng\u2019s speech to the U.S.-China Business Council\u2019s annual gala in mid-December is perhaps the best example of this major shift in tone. Different Roads to San Francisco The United States and China both wanted the meeting to be successful, but their leaders arrived in San Francisco on very different trajectories. President Biden came in with the wind at his back. The U.S. economy has recovered; growth has regained momentum, while inflation has slowed. Although Congress seems locked in eternal battles internally and with the executive branch, it did adopt, in consultation with the administration, major pieces of legislation\u2014the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the CHIPS and Science Act\u2014that will provide a stronger foundation for the U.S. economy in the coming years. Moreover, the United States\u2019 relations with allies in Asia and Europe have improved dramatically in general and with respect to their approach toward China in particular. Analysis of the challenge China poses on economic and national security issues sounds increasingly similar whether one is in Tokyo, Berlin, Brussels, Washington, or other advanced market democracies. Closer alignment has been generated by China\u2019s increasingly ambitious and distortionary industrial policies, the human rights situation in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, China\u2019s close ties with Russia and its approach to Ukraine, instances of economic coercion by Beijing, and the worsening security situation in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and along the China-India border. The narrowing of differences reflects a greater willingness by the Biden administration, relative to its predecessor, to develop a foreign policy framework rooted in longtime alignments with allies, as well as a willingness to shift its own language and approach in a way that is more comfortable to friends in Europe and Asia. This certainly applies to the administration\u2019s emphasis since the spring of 2023 that it is pursuing \u201cde-risking,\u201d not decoupling. At the same time, likeminded countries have become more willing to be openly critical of China and develop a range of policy responses, individually and together with others. This is most visible in the area of economic security, for example, with Japan\u2019s Economic Security Promotion Act and the European Commission\u2019s investigation into subsidies for China\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) sector. Although there are still significant frictions\u2014U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum, different approaches to data security and privacy, and disagreement over how to reform the World Trade Organization (WTO)\u2014the dramatic reduction in differences between Washington and its allies is the more important trend. President Xi, by contrast, came in facing substantial domestic and international headwinds as a result of his changing policies at home and abroad. China\u2019s zero-Covid policies, which initially were successful in 2020 and 2021, proved to be a failure in 2022 in the face of the Omicron variant. Lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere generated widespread anger, and the sudden removal of restrictions in late 2022 in the face of protests left many Chinese people feeling abandoned. The economic front has brought a long string of bad news: the extended crackdown on the private tech sector, the imposition of a range of national security\u2013oriented laws, the shrinking of the workforce and graying of the population, the property market\u2019s woes, and growing restrictions on access to Western markets and technology. China\u2019s economy may meet its official economic growth target for 2023 of around five percent, but the recovery has been far slower than expected, and the sense of inevitable continued economic success has disappeared. Xi\u2019s record abroad has been equally problematic. Tensions with the United States, growing frictions in the Taiwan Strait, and alignment with Russia have brought the United States and its allies together. Access to Western technology and markets has been constrained, and global supply chains are gradually reducing their disproportionate reliance on China. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has attracted criticism for failed projects that have added to the debt load of developing countries. The combination of problems at home and abroad has led to a crisis of confidence among Chinese citizens, who have become far less certain about their individual and collective futures than at any time in the last three decades. Xi Jinping himself may exude self-confidence and believe that the \u201cEast is rising and the West is declining,\u201d but he has not persuaded his populace of this prediction. Hence, Xi needs to stabilize relations with the United States and the West more generally, not only for foreign policy reasons but to rebuild confidence at home, which is central to generating growth and maintaining social stability. That is why China\u2019s bark has been bigger than its bite. Xi attended the APEC summit and held the bilateral meeting with Biden despite the fact that Washington made essentially no concessions to get Xi to California. In the months leading up to APEC, the administration issued an executive order on outbound investment, stepped up export controls on the semiconductor industry, and held firm in not inviting Hong Kong chief executive John Lee to the APEC leaders\u2019 meeting. Beijing has sent signals of potential penalties through its investigation into a few consulting firms and by placing several minerals on its export control list, but it has not pulled the trigger on any of these yet, fearful that doing so would accelerate the decoupling it still hopes to avoid. Sources of Stability Xi\u2019s problems at home and abroad have left the impression that his conciliatory moves are tactical gestures that will be only temporary and fade away once China\u2019s economy rebounds and domestic confidence in his leadership is restored or will disappear suddenly if Lai Ching-te, Taiwan\u2019s current vice president and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate, wins Taiwan\u2019s presidential election in mid-January and China is compelled to react with dramatic moves. Such concerns are entirely reasonable, but observers should appreciate that the sources of recent tempering of stresses are rooted in three structural characteristics of the relationship. The credible military deterrents that the United States and China both maintain against the other form the first source of stability. China\u2019s relative power has risen dramatically in recent years, and the United States and others take as credible Chinese threats to use force in the Taiwan Strait if Taiwan were to cross any of Beijing\u2019s red lines. Conversely, the U.S. credibility to provide defensive support to Taiwan and its allies has been strengthened through the development of the Quad and AUKUS, improved bilateral relations with countries around China\u2019s periphery, and its support to Ukraine. Equally important, although there are \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d wings in Taiwan\u2019s political spectrum regarding their ideal preferences for cross-strait outcomes, in the context of realistic constraints, the vast majority of the population\u2014and the political parties\u2014are one or another shade of turquoise. In sum, the astronomical costs of an outbreak of hostilities have created a widely shared preference in favor of maintaining the status quo. Second, although U.S.-China bilateral trade and investment ties have stagnated, the two countries are still embedded in an extensive web of complex interdependence across all aspects of their economies and broader societies, which extends to countries around the world. Interconnectivity has created certain vulnerabilities, such as overdependence for critical goods and the potential transfer of dual-use technologies, but it also has created extensive economic and national security benefits that raise the costs of conflict and the value of continued interaction to both sides. Understandably, neither side is keen to abandon such ties. The fact that other countries are deeply connected to the United States and China further raises the costs to Washington and Beijing from taking precipitous actions. Interdependence is no panacea, but it is a structural feature shaping the choices of all parties. Finally, the resumption of regular people-to-people ties, track 2 dialogues, and official consultations, in the wake of their collapse due to the Covid-19 pandemic, provides another set of stabilizers. Washington and Beijing have established roughly a dozen working groups on a wide range of topics, and the two governments now have normal interactions at the cabinet and working levels. So far there has been one recent congressional delegation , in October 2023, and there likely will be more in 2024. Communication does not necessarily generate momentum for extensive cooperation, but it provides pathways for reducing misunderstanding about policies and broader developments in both countries and elsewhere. Looking Ahead to 2024 The new normal of what could be called \u201ccompetition without conflict\u201d does not presage a return to the era of engagement, but the United States and China deserve credit for reducing the chances of the worst negative tail risks, including outright decoupling and military conflict. That said, the short-term incentives and long-term structural features of relations guarantee absolutely nothing. Maintaining momentum in 2024 will require a series of steps on the domestic, bilateral, and multilateral fronts. Most urgently, every effort must be taken to avoid an escalation of tensions and outright conflict in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. The outcome of the Taiwan election is in doubt, but there should be no doubt that all sides need to act with prudence once the results are announced, and that extraordinary vigilance will be needed through the inauguration of Taiwan\u2019s next leader in May and their first few months in office. Equally complex will be finding a way to defuse tensions involving China and the Philippines around Second Thomas Shoal in the face of Beijing\u2019s increasingly aggressive moves. Next, with the creation of new channels for dialogue, the United States and China need to move forward with consultations on all fronts, including on trade, technology, artificial intelligence, climate, and security issues. Given the previous dearth of communication, discussion itself will be valuable, but before long it will be reasonable to expect the two sides to refine their agenda in each working group and gradually shift from consultations to negotiations that deliver substantive results. It will be equally important for the Biden administration to expand and deepen consultations and coordination with allies in Europe and Asia on China policy. General agreement about de-risking needs to be accompanied by more concrete alignment or harmonization with regard to the implementation of economic security in a range of sectors (semiconductors, EVs, and critical minerals being the most urgent), rules related to the digital economy, carrying out commitments from the latest UN Climate Change Conference (COP28), and how to resuscitate the WTO and keep the global trading system from collapsing. Finally, the Biden administration needs to further develop the architecture of its China policy. The administration deserves credit for putting meat on the bones of its three-pronged strategy of \u201cinvest, align and compete,\u201d enunciating the goal of de-risking while maintaining extensive economic ties, and resuming extensive dialogue. It can build on this progress by clarifying the goals of its China policy. This begins by further articulating how the United States aims to strengthen and reform the rules-based international order and then, on that basis, how relations with China should be managed in light of those broader goals. Equally important is to begin an evaluation of the effectiveness of its approach across a range of areas. For example, what are the right metrics to measure progress with regard to advancement of American technology innovation, reduced overdependence on China, and the imposition of security-based restrictions on Chinese industry? That will then offer a foundation for judging whether U.S. policy is making progress, having unintended consequences, or both. In short, in 2024 the Biden administration needs to take steps to institutionalize the various elements of its China policy. Doing so could mean making measurable progress and having a less volatile year than many foresee, which would make its approach less vulnerable to criticism from Beijing, other countries, and other domestic perspectives. The last source of disagreement is particularly important given that China policy undoubtedly will be a central topic of discussion in the lead-up to the United States\u2019 congressional and presidential elections in November.
