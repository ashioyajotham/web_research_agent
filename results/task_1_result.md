PET PRESIDENT XI: (As interpreted.) Can you put on your earpiece? We have simultaneous interpreting. PRESIDENT BIDEN: I\u2019ve learned to speak Chinese. (Laughter.) Wish I did. PRESIDENT XI: Okay, let me begin first. It\u2019s a great pleasure to see you again, President Biden. Over the past four years, China-U.S. relations have gone through ups and downs. But under our joint stewardship, the two sides have also been engaged in fruitful dialogue and cooperation, and the relationship has been kept stable on the whole. These developments reconfirmed the experiences and lessons of the past of 45 years of China-U.S. diplomatic ties. When the two countries treat each other as partner and friend, seek common ground while (inaudible) differences, and help each other succeed, our relationship would make considerable progress. But if we take each other as rival or adversary, pursue vicious competition, and seek to hurt each other, we would roil the relationship or even set it back. The world today is turbulent, plagued by conflicts. Old problems are compounded by new ones. Humanity is faced with unprecedented challenges. Major country competition should not be the underlying logic of the times. Only solidarity and cooperation can help humanity overcome current difficulties. In an age of flourishing sci-tech revolution, neither decoupling nor supply chain disruption is a solution. Only mutually beneficial cooperation can lead to common development. \u201cSmall yard, high fences\u201d is not what a major country should pursue. Only openness and sharing can improve the well-being of humanity. As two major countries, China and the United States should bear in mind the interests of the whole world and inject more certainty and positive energy into the turbulent world. It is my consistent belief that as the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship, a stable China-U.S. relationship is critical not only to the interests of the Chinese and American peoples, but also to the future and destiny of the entire humanity. The two countries should bear in mind the well-being of the two peoples and the common interests of the international community, make the wise choice, keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other, and realize the long-term peaceful coexistence of China and the United States on this planet. The United States has recently concluded its elections. China\u2019s goal of a stable, healthy, and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Our commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and winning cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Our position of resolutely safeguarding China\u2019s sovereignty, security, and development interests remains unchanged. Our desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged. China is ready to work with the new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation, and manage differences so as to strive for a steady transition of the China-U.S. relationship for the benefit of the two peoples. I look forward to an in-depth exchange of views with you on China-U.S. relations and on issues of mutual interest. Thank you. PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. It\u2019s good to see you and see all of you again. You know, one year ago, we met in the Woodside Summit in San Francisco. And I\u2019m very proud of the progress we\u2019ve both made together. On military communication, at multiple levels our leaders are now regularly talking to one another on a regular basis. On AI, we have brought together our nations\u2019 experts together to discuss risks and safety. Our counternarcotics \u2014 on that issue, we resumed cooperation. And I want to note: In my country, Mr. President, overdose deaths are coming down for the first time in five years. We have a lot to discuss, but let me close with this. Over \u2014 for over a decade, you and I have spent many hours together, both here and in China and in between. And, you know, we \u2014 I think we\u2019ve spent a long time \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 dealing with these issues. Let me close with this. We \u2014 I think \u2014 and I once had to count up the number of hours you and I spent alone together. I remember being on the Tibetan Plateau with you and I remember being in Beijing. I remember \u2014 all over the world. And \u2014 both as my \u2014 first as vice president, then as president. We haven\u2019t always agreed, but our conversations have always been candid and always been frank. We have never kidded one another. We\u2019ve been level with one another. And I think that\u2019s vital. These conversations prevent miscalculations, and they ensure the competition between our two countries will not veer into conflict \u2014 be competition, not conflict. And that\u2019s our responsibility to our people and, as you indicated, to the people around the world. We are the most important alliance or most important re- \u2014 relationship in the entire world. And how we get along together is going to impact the rest of the world. And \u2014 so, you know, our two countries cannot let any of this competition veer into conflict. And as I said, that\u2019s our responsibility. And over the last four years, I think we\u2019ve proven it\u2019s possible to have this relationship. And \u2014 but \u2014 so, Mr. President, I\u2019m anxious to get our meeting starting and discuss the issues we have remaining. Thank you. 4:14 P.M. PET President Joseph R.

Advertisement The meeting lasted more than 3\u00bd hours, and statements issued by both sides described it as a candid exchange. Here are some of the main points each leader raised, based on readouts from the Chinese foreign ministry and the White House. Xi Jinping: \u201cIn the next 50 years, the most important thing in international relations is that China and the United States must find the right way to get along.\u201d \u201cSuch moves are extremely dangerous, just like playing with fire. Whoever plays with fire will get burnt,\u201d Xi said of US involvement in the Taiwan Strait. \u201cIf the \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 separatist forces provoke or cross our red line, we will have to take decisive measures.\u201d \u201cWe are willing to engage in dialogue on human rights issues on the basis of mutual respect, but we do not approve of interfering in other countries\u2019 internal affairs through human rights issues.\u201d \u201cThe US should stop abusing or overstretching the concept of national security to suppress Chinese businesses. It is imperative for China and the US to maintain communication on macroeconomic policies, support world economic recovery and guard against ... risks.\u201d \u201cAs the leader of China, I can serve the 1.4 billion Chinese people, and together, create a better life with them ... My attitude is, \u2018I shall put aside my own well-being and live up to people\u2019s expectations\u2019.\u201d Chinese President Xi Jinping, in Beijing, during the virtual meeting on Tuesday. Photo: Xinhua Joe Biden : \u201cOur responsibility as leaders of China and the United States is to ensure that the competition between our countries does not veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended. Just simple, straightforward competition.\u201d \u201cWe need to establish some common sense guardrails, to be clear and honest where we disagree, and work together where our interests intersect, especially on vital global issues like climate change .\u201d \u201cWe have a responsibility to the world, as well as to our people. It\u2019s why we believe \u2026 all countries have to play by the same rules of the road, why the United States is always going to stand up for our interests and values and those of our allies and partners.\u201d Biden \u201cunderscored that the United States remains committed to the one-China policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three joint communiques and the six assurances, and that the United States strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait\u201d, according to the White House readout. He also emphasised that the US \u201cwill continue to stand up for its interests and values and, together with our allies and partners, ensure the rules of the road for the 21st century advance an international system that is free, open and fair\u201d.

EDT THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Now, I assume you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re standing in case you have to run when the rain starts. (Laughter.) Please, have a seat. Rox, thank you very much for all you do to fight for American steelworkers.\u00c2 I mean that sincerely.\u00c2 I \u2014 and I want to recognize all the labor unions here today, including Steel Workers, Auto Workers, Sheet Metal Workers, AFL-CIO, IBEW, Communications Workers, Boilermakers, Machinists. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud, as Rox said, to be labeled the most pro-union President in American history. You heard me say it before: Wall Street is important, lot of good folks there, but they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build America. The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class. Folks, leaders from key American industries are here as well, including steel, aluminum, solar, semiconductors, automakers. And members of my Cabinet are here as well. Janet Yellen \u2014 the front row is Murderers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Row here \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 the Treasury Department; Julie Su, our Trade \u2014 our \u2014 of \u2014 of Labor; and Katherine Tai, our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trade Representative; and outstanding members of Congress as well. From Michigan, Debbie Stabenow is here. Debbie, welcome. And Hala- \u2014 and Haley Stevens is here. No, I guess she \u2014 there you are. Oh, you did make it. They told me you might not be able to make it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry. REPRESENTATIVE STEVENS: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here. (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT: All right. And Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. Again, you \u2014 smile, Debbie, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay. (Laughter.) REPRESENTATIVE DINGELL: I am. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy. THE PRESIDENT: Elissa Slotkin \u2014 Well, you should be. You \u2014 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u2014 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re responsible for a lot of this. Thank you for joining us as I announce a series of actions to make sure American workers and American business and corporations can compete and win in the industries of the future, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what this is about. The fact is that American workers are \u2014 can outwork and outcompete anyone, as long as the competition is fair. But for too long, it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been fair. For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies across a whole range of industries: steel and aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, solar panels \u2014 the industries of the future \u2014 and even critical health equipment, like gloves and masks. China heavily subsidized all these products, pushing Chinese companies to produce far more than the rest of the world can absorb. And then dumping the excess products onto the market at unfairly low prices, driving other manufacturers around the world out of business. You know, we \u2014 I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into it, but we were talking about today about how many aluminum plants there used to be and how many there are now. The prices are unfairly low because Chinese companies don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to worry about a profit because the Chinese government subsidized them and subsidized them heavily. And the Chinese relies on other anticompetitive tactics as well, like forcing the American companies to transfer their technology in order to do business in China. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent a lot of time with Xi Jinping. Early on, I told him \u2014 he said, why am I being unfair with China? (Inaudible.) I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll play by the same rules if you want. If you want to do business in China, you got to have a 51 percent Chinese owner, you got to provide access to all your intellectual property, et cetera. You want to do that in America?\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was silence. Sometimes they just outright steal through cyber espionage and other means. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a well-documented inter- \u2014 and internationally recognized. When you make tactics like these, they are \u2014 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u2014 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not competing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not competition. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheating. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the damage here in America. To name one example, back in 2000, when cheap steel from China began to flood the market, U.S. steel towns across Pennsylvania and Ohio were hit hard. And any of you from those areas know well. More than 1,800 [18,000] ironworkers and steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Ohio lost their jobs. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to let that happen again. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why today I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m announcing new tariffs in key sectors of the economy that are going to ensure that our workers are not held back by unfair trade practices. They include a thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m announcing today: 25 percent tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum products. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll counter China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overcapacity in these industries. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making major investments in clean American steel and aluminum \u2014 clean American steel and aluminum. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big deal. Clean because of the way we manufacture it here \u2014 it emits half as much carbon as steel made in China. Last month, my administration announced the largest investment in clean manufacturing in all of history, up to $1.5 billion in six clean steel projects across America, creating and supporting thousands \u2014 thousands of union jobs. Next, a 100 percent tariff on electric vehicles made in China. And people say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Applause.) Because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to let China flood our market, making it impossible for American automakers \u2014 automobile \u2014 auto manufacturers to compete fairly. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also implementing a 25 percent tariff on electric vehicle batteries from China and a 25 percent tariff on the critical minerals that make those batteries. Folks, look, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m determined that the future of the electric vehicles will be made in America by union workers.\u00c2 Period.\u00c2 (Applause.)\u00c2 And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do it by following international trade laws to do it.\u00c2 American companies are investing tens of billions of dollars in electric vehicles and their batteries. And thanks to my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building a network of 500,000 charging stations all across America, creating thousands \u2014 thousands of IBEW jobs across America. Electric charging stations \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and the reason to do this is simple: Electric charging stations have to be as easy to find as a gas station, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what this will be. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to have to worry about \u2014 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking off and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be able to make it all across the country in one \u2014 without having to figure something else out. Our partners around the world are making similar investments. They also want a supply chain for electric vehicles that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dominated by unfair trade practices from China. America can continue to buy \u2014 Americans \u2014 I want to make this clear, notwithstanding what the other guy is saying \u2014 can buy any kind of car they want \u2014 whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gas, electric, or hybrid \u2014 but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never going to allow China to fa- \u2014 unfairly control the market for these cars. Period. Next \u2014 (applause) \u2014 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to raise tariffs on Chinese solar panels from 25 to 50 percent.\u00c2 Here, again, because the Chinese government is subsidizing excess capacity, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re flooding the market.\u00c2 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re driving manufacturing companies out of business in Europe.\u00c2 But we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let that happen here in America. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re putting a 50 percent tariff on semiconductors made in China.\u00c2 These are those tiny computer \u2014 all of you know this, but for the public \u2014 those little, tiny computer chips, smaller than a fingertip, that power everyday lives \u2014 everything from smartphones to automobiles to dishwashers, satellites.\u00c2 Look, America invented these cheeps [chips]. But over time, we stopped making them. We invested other \u2014 overseas. Now, thanks to my CHIPS and Science Act, one of the most significant investments ever in science and technology, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing this vital industry back home where it started, in the United States of America. (Applause.) And finally, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re putting tariffs on health equipment, like masks and gloves that nurses and doctors wear every single day. If the pandemic caught us any- \u2014 tau- \u2014 taught us anything, we need a secure ply- \u2014 supply of essential supplies here at home. Folks, these key sectors, my administration is combining investments in America with tariffs that are strategic and targeted. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a smart approach. Compare that to the pri- \u2014 what the prior administration did. The \u2014 my predecessor promised to increase American exports and boost manufacturing. But he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t either. He failed. He signed a trade deal with China. They were supposed to buy $200 billion more in American goods. Instead, China imports from America barely budged. And now, Trump and his MAGA Republicans want across-the-board tariffs on all imports from all countries, if reelected. Well, that would drive up costs for families on an average of $1,500 per year each year. He simply doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it. For years, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard many Republicans and even Democratic friends say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is not on the rise\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 excuse me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is on the rise; America is falling behind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always believed they got it wrong. America is rising. We have the best economy in the world. And since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come into office, the GDP is up, our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest level in over a decade, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re standing up against Chinese government unfair economic practices now. At the same time \u2014 (applause) \u2014 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve revitalized our partnerships with the Pacific allies in India, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines \u2014 Pacific Island nations. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made sure the most advanced American technologies we develop or invent can be used by the Chi- \u2014 can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be used by the Chinese government to undermine our national security. Frankly, before it rains \u2014 frankly, for all this tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that. Bottom line: I want fair competition with China, not conflict. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a stronger position to win that economic competition of the 21st century against China than anyone else because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing in America again. Let me close \u2014 let me close with this. I come from Scranton, a town like a lot of working-class, middle-class neighborhoods all across America \u2014 like Racine, Wisconsin, which I visited last week. Once a manufacturing boomtown until trickle-down economics came along, and the middle class in Racine got hollowed out. Six years ago, my predecessor showed up carrying a golden shovel, promising, thanks to his new $10 billion, manufacturing complex would be built in Racine. He said it would be the eighth wonder of the world \u2014 big promises that never came true. He used that golden shovel to dig a hole, and then he fell into it. (Laughter.) Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not on my \u2014 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not part of my \u2014 well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m delivering for Racine \u2014 delivering. Thanks to the investment of my administration, Microsoft is investing billions to build a new data center in Racine, creating thousands of good-paying jobs. Because the view from Scranton and towns like it are a lot different than from Mar-a-Lago. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the view where \u2014 that money doesn\u2019t determine your worth, everyone is entitled to being treated with dignity and respect, and everyone deserves a fair shot. We leave nobody behind. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the America we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building together. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been more optimistic about our future. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really going fast because of the rain. We have \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we have to remember who we are. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the United States of America. (Applause.) And there is nothing \u2014 there is nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. God bless you all. And better get out of the rain. Thank you very, very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Oh, we got to sign this. Q Mr. President, why wait three years for the tariffs? (The presidential memorandum is signed.) THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Q Mr. President \u2014 Q Mr. President, is Netanyahu going too far in Rafah? Q Mr. President, Trump said today, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is eating our lunch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What do you say in response? He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is eating our lunch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what Trump said today. THE PRESIDENT: He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being feeding them a long time.

Photograph: Nhac Nguyen/AFP/Getty Images Joe Biden This article is more than 2 years old Joe Biden calls for stable US-China relationship during south-east Asia tour This article is more than 2 years old US president\u2019s remarks came after after meeting in Vietnam with Communist party official to secure global supply chain Edward Helmore Sun 10 Sep 2023 18.05 BST Last modified on Mon 11 Sep 2023 15.55 BST Share Joe Biden \u2019s national security tour of south-east Asia reached Hanoi, Vietnam, on Sunday, where the president called for stability in the US-China relationship against an increasingly complex diplomatic picture in the region for his country. \u201cI don\u2019t want to contain China ,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI just want to make sure that we have a relationship with China that is on the up and up, squared away, everybody knows what it\u2019s all about.\u201d Biden also said that China\u2019s recent economic downturn may limit any inclination to invade Taiwan. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to cause China to invade Taiwan \u2013 matter of fact the opposite, probably doesn\u2019t have the same capacity as it had before,\u201d he said on Sunday during a press conference in Hanoi. He added that the country\u2019s economic woes had left President Xi Jinping with \u201chis hands full right now\u201d. The president\u2019s remarks came after a meeting with Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of Vietnam\u2019s ruling Communist party, in the nation\u2019s capital designed to secure global supply chains of semiconductors and critical minerals, which would offer a strategic alternative to China . \u201cI think we have an enormous opportunity,\u201d Biden said of the visit. \u201cVietnam and the United States are critical partners at what I would argue is a very critical time.\u201d G20: battle for influence as US seeks to rival China in the global south Read more The meeting came during a multi-front diplomatic push to shore up international support for Ukrainian resistance to Russia\u2019s invasion and enunciate a policy toward China that both encourages trade and reduces the potential for US-Chinese conflict. The complexities of the administration\u2019s approach were illustrated on Saturday, a day before Biden landed in Hanoi, when the New York Times reported that Vietnam was in talks with Russia over a new arms supply deal that could trigger US sanctions. Reuters said it had seen \u2013 but could not authenticate \u2013 documents describing talks for a credit facility that Russia would extend to Vietnam to buy heavy weaponry, including anti-ship missiles, anti-submarine aircraft and helicopters, anti-aircraft missile systems and fighter jets. Earlier, at the G20 summit in New Delhi, India , western leaders failed to reiterate an explicit condemnation of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The summit declaration referred only to the \u201cwar in Ukraine\u201d and lamented the \u201csuffering\u201d of the Ukrainian people \u2013 an equivocation that indicates a growing lack of international consensus. Less than a year ago, G20 leaders issued a strong condemnation of the Russian invasion and called on Moscow to withdraw its forces. View image in fullscreen Joe Biden waves to children after a military welcome ceremony at the presidential palace in Hanoi, Vietnam, on 10 September 2023. Photograph: Luong Thai Linh/AP Biden\u2019s secretary of state, Antony Blinken , attempted to smooth over the disparity, telling ABC\u2019s This Week that world leaders meeting in New Delhi had \u201cstood up very clearly, including in the statement, for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d. Blinken said that virtually every meeting participant \u201cis intent on making sure there is a just and durable end to this Russian aggression\u201d. It was clear in the room, he said, that \u201ccountries are feeling the consequences and want the Russian aggression to stop\u201d. The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said: \u201cThe vast majority of G20 countries have supported multiple UN resolutions that call out Russia\u2019s illegal aggression.\u201d Jean-Pierre said the New Delhi communique \u201cbuilds on that, to send an unprecedented, unified statement on the imperative that Russia refrain from using force for territorial acquisition, abide by its obligations in the UN charter, and cease attacks on civilians and infrastructure\u201d. The comments came as a CBS News poll found only one in four Americans think Biden is improving the US\u2019s global position. According to the survey, 24% thought Biden was making the US stronger, 50% said weaker and 26% that he was not having much effect. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked if the Biden administration was being \u201ctoo easy\u201d on China, 57% agreed. On CNN, the Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley slammed the Biden administration\u2019s policy toward China, describing the country as an \u201cenemy\u201d. \u201cChina has practically been preparing for war with us for years,\u201d Haley said. \u201cYes, I view China as an enemy.\u201d Haley said China had bought 400,000 acres (162,000 hectares) of US soil and the largest pork producer in the country, and continues to steal $600bn a year in intellectual property while spreading propaganda. She pointed to Chinese drones used by US law enforcement and to the crisis caused by Chinese-sourced fentanyl that \u201chad killed more Americans than the Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam war combined\u201d. \u201cHow much more has to happen for Biden to realize you don\u2019t send cabinet members over to China to appease them?\u201d she said, referring to the recent visit of the US commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, to Beijing. The administration\u2019s effort to present a coherent picture of US foreign policy toward its two most vexing issues \u2013 China and Russia \u2013 continued Sunday with Vice-President Kamala Harris telling CBS News that a planned meeting between North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin \u201cwould be a huge mistake\u201d. \u201cWhen you look at Russia\u2019s unprovoked war on Ukraine, and the idea that they would supply ammunition to Russia \u2013 well, it\u2019s predictable where that ends up,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI also believe very strongly that for both Russia and North Korea, this will further isolate them.\u201d Harris also spoke to an emerging concern that China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, who skipped the G20, may decline to attend the Asia-Pacific economic cooperation leaders\u2019 meeting in San Francisco, California, in November. Last week, China\u2019s security agency hinted that a meeting between Xi and Biden in San Francisco would depend on the US \u201cshowing sufficient sincerity\u201d. China\u2019s ministry of state security said that the country \u201cwill never let its guard down\u201d. The comments came after Raimondo said the US did not want to decouple from China but that American companies had complained to her that China had become \u201cuninvestible\u201d. Asked how important it was for Xi Jinping to come to America, Harris remarked that \u201cit is important to the \u2026 stability of things that we keep open lines of communication\u201d.

Share Biden Targets China During State of Union Speech share Print BEIJING \u2014 U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday criticized China\u2019s \"unfair economic practices\" and insisted he has done a better job standing up to Beijing than did former President Donald Trump, his rival in this year\u2019s presidential election. In his State of the Union address, Biden also touted other aspects of his China policy, including \"standing up for peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits\" and revitalizing \"our partnerships and alliances in the Pacific.\" \"I\u2019ve made sure that the most advanced American technologies can\u2019t be used in China ... frankly for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that,\" Biden added. Biden\u2019s China comments, which made up only a brief part of his nationally televised speech, come a day after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi escalated his country\u2019s verbal attacks on the United States. On the sidelines of an annual meeting of China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress, Wang accused the United States of trying to contain China through sanctions, and insisted that Washington has \"wrong perceptions\" about Beijing. \"The means to suppress China are constantly updated, the list of unilateral sanctions is constantly extended, and the desire to inflict punishment on China has reached an unimaginable level,\" said Wang during what appeared to be a tightly scripted interaction with local and foreign media. Wang\u2019s comments were a contrast from September, when Biden met Chinese President Xi Jinping in California. At that meeting, both sides agreed to restart dialogue and cooperate on several initiatives, including to counter the flow of fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid, into the United States. While Wang acknowledged that \"some progress\" was made at what he called the \"historic meeting,\" he accused the United States of breaking some of its promises. \"If the United States always says one thing and does another, where will its credibility be as a major country? If the United States is nervous and anxious whenever it hears the word 'China,' where is the self-confidence of a major country?\" Wang said. Even as high-level talks resumed, the United States has expanded sanctions against China on a range of issues, from human rights abuses to its relations with Russia. U.S.-China ties are also strained over a wide range of other issues, including China\u2019s behavior in disputed areas of the South China Sea, its military intimidation of Taiwan, and a growing U.S.-China technological competition. Political cudgel In his speech Thursday, Biden reiterated that he wants \"competition with China, but not conflict,\" while noting that the United States is \"in a stronger position to win the competition for the 21st century against China or anyone else for that matter.\" \"For years, I\u2019ve heard many of my Republican and Democratic friends say that China is on the rise and America is falling behind. They\u2019ve got it backwards ... America is rising,\" Biden said. \"We have the best economy in the world. And since I\u2019ve come to office, our GDP is up. Our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade,\" he added. China is expected to get more public attention as the U.S. presidential election campaign intensifies. On Thursday, both Biden, a Democrat, and U.S. Senator Katie Britt, who delivered the Republican response, used China to attack their political opponents. \"The Chinese Communist Party is undercutting America\u2019s workers. China is buying up our farmland, spying on our military installations, and spreading propaganda through the likes of TikTok,\" Britt said, referring to the popular video-sharing social media app owned by a Chinese company. \"The CCP knows that if it conquers the minds of our next generation, it conquers America,\" Britt said. \"And what does President Biden do? He bans TikTok for government employees, but creates an account for his own campaign.\" U.S. lawmakers are making a renewed push to pass legislation that would effectively force Beijing-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within six months or face a U.S. ban. Some U.S. lawmakers warn ByteDance could pass private information about U.S. users to China\u2019s Communist Party \u2013 an allegation rejected by the company\u2019s CEO. Previous attempts to ban TikTok have been unsuccessful. But despite recent developments, U.S.-China relations remain more stable than in past years, said Wang Huiyao, the founder and president of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization. \"We don't want to see a downward spiral like we used to have. Because if that happens, that could be very dangerous for not only the U.S. and China, but for the world,\" Wang told VOA during an interview at his office. \"I\u2019m still cautiously optimistic,\" Wang said. \"Because people realize that [after] the last six, seven years, if the U.S. and China really get into a very ugly situation, then the whole world is finished.\" Related Transcript of the Republican Response to the State of the Union Address Biden Calls for Defending Democracy in State of Union Address Biden Reaffirms Need to Free American Journalist Jailed in Russia Israel, Immigration Feature in Biden's State of the Union Speech More US Stories All About America The Day in Photos \u200b Follow Us United States US News All About America World Africa The Americas East Asia Pacific Europe Middle East South & Central Asia Sections VOA Programs Special projects Day in Photos VOA News on Iran VOA News on China 52 Documentary Videos More From VOA VOAAfrica.com Programs VOA Learning English Editorials About this site Terms of Use & Privacy Notice About VOA Get VOA+ VOA Around the World Contact VOA Media Relations Usage Requests VOA Pronunciation Guide XS SM MD LG",

It is one of the most challenging foreign policy relationship that President Biden inherited from his predecessor. In his first press conference, President Biden said: \u201cThis is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21 st century and autocracies.\u201d He further said: \u201cWe have got to prove democracy works.\u201d To a large extent, the issues of friction have remained the same as those under Donald Trump. Against this background the paper analyzes the developments in the US-China relations under the Biden administration. While addressing the Congress, in his first speech to Congress, President Biden assured the maintenance of a strong US military presence in the Indo-Pacific and promised to boost technological development and trade. \u201cChina and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future.\u201d [i] It may be noted, the day President Biden assumed office, China imposed sanctions on the outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other 27 officials for their posture towards China. This was meant to intimidate the new government. [ii] President Joe Biden and Xi Jinping had the first virtual meeting on 16 November 2021. (Earlier, the leaders had spoken twice.) The meeting lasted for three and a half-hour. The two leaders discussed issues of trade, Taiwan and human rights. Both sides issued separate statements listing their concerns. There was no major outcome of the meeting nor was there any joint statement. [iii] Xi Jinping laid out three principles and four priority areas for the China-US relations. [iv] However, there were no similar statements from the US side. US-China trade friction marks a highly contested aspect of bilateral relations. While speaking to the United Steelworkers in May 2020, President Biden had said: \u201cI will use tariffs when they are needed, but the difference between me and Trump is that I will have a strategy-a plan \u2013to use those tariffs to win, not just to fake toughness\u201d. [v] The US new approach to the US-China bilateral trade relationship was articulated by US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai at the CSIS. [vi] Her remarks at CSIS indicated that the US is looking forward to assessing and discussing the \u201cPhase One\u201d trade agreement signed under Donald Trump in January 2020, launching a new review process to look at Section 301 tariffs on Chinese exports, to address China\u2019s \u201cstate-centred\u201d trade policies and practices, including what USTR deems to be trade-distorting industrial policies and to focus on working with allies and like-minded countries to address issues of mutual concern relating to China, and to shape the rules for fair trade to facilitate \u201ca race to the top\u201d for market economies. [vii] In addition, two meetings have also been held between the trade representative of the US and China but no breakthrough has been achieved so far. [viii] It may be recalled that on 14 February 2020, the US and China entered into the first phase of the trade agreement, the Economic and Trade Agreement between the US and the People\u2019s Republic of China. [ix] According to the agreement, China agreed to purchase certain US goods and services worth USD 200 billion for two years, starting from 1 January 2020 through 31 December 2021 with 2017 as the baseline year. According to a study by Chad P. Bown of Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), it is evident that China bought none of the items promised Source: Peterson Institute for International Economics [x] However, irrespective of the trade friction, China is the second-largest trading partner of the US after the European Union (EU). The total trade value between China and the US is USD 682.32 billion from January to November in 2021, a year-on-year increase of 30.2 per cent. [xi] China sells almost four times to the US. [xii] The Ambassador of China to the US has said that the \u201cChina-US economic and trade relations are win-win in nature\u201d. He also reiterated that closer economic cooperation between the US-China is not only crucial but also mutually beneficial as the two economies are interdependent. [xiii] . [xiv] As of now, officials from the US have asked for concrete actions from China to purchase US goods and services as under the \u201cPhase One\u201d trade deal. [xv] Overall, the Biden administration has continued protesting China\u2019s economic policies that led to the starting of the trade war. [xvi] President Biden banned 59 firms for their ties with China\u2019s military or surveillance industry, including Huawei Technology and other telecommunication companies. [xvii] On 16 December 2021, the Biden administration imposed trade restrictions on more than 30 Chinese research institutes and entities over human rights violations and alleged development of technologies, for example, brain-control weapons, that affect US national security. [xviii] The trade war has further percolated down to the issue of technology and has become the forefront of the US-China frictions. Under Donald Trump, the US had accused China of cyber theft of intellectual property, coerced IP transfers and unfair trade practices. The US had argued that if China could ban Google and Facebook from entering China, similarly the US can ban Huawei and ZTE . [xix] The Trump administration had tightened restrictions on Huawei by cutting its access to the US components and technology. [xx] This made China aware of the US approach. Xi Jinping has reiterated, \u201cTechnology innovation has become the main battleground in the global strategic game\u201d. Consequently, this has made the US more conscious and they are scrutinising Chinese technical investment more closely. [xxi] The trend has continued under President Biden. In November, the US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo included eight China-based technology entities to the Entity List \u201cto prevent US\u2019 emerging technologies from being used for the PRC\u2019s quantum computing efforts that support military applications\u201d. Subsequently, the US added 37 more entities to its Entity List to \u201cdeter misuse of biotechnology\u201d and other technologies \u201cfor military applications and human rights abuses\u201d. [xxii] Last year President Biden had signed Executive Order 14017 to assess the US vulnerabilities in the critical supply chain. Within six months, the administration came out with a complete comprehensive review of the supply chains for four critical products and established a Supply Chain Disruption Taskforce (SCDTF) to address the challenges arising from the pandemic. An annual report has also been published identifying their vulnerabilities and strategies. [xxiii] In addition, the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength Act of 2022 (the America COMPETES Act of 2022) was passed on 4 February 2022. The Act covers scientific research, economic competitiveness, and funding for the domestic production of semiconductors. It also contained a list of motions on the human rights situation in Xinjiang, a crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong and increasing tensions over Taiwan. [xxiv] The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian has criticised the act. He said the content in the bill regarding China has a \u201cCold-War mentality and zero-sum game mindset\u201d. [xxv] On Taiwan, President Biden\u2019s views were articulated through his two articles written in 2001 and 2020. In 2001, Joe Biden wrote an article in the Washington Post , \u201cNot so deft on Taiwan\u201d [xxvi] ; at this point he was critical of the US support to Taiwan and preferred to maintain strategic ambiguity. Before the US elections, in 2020 he wrote another article for New York-based Chinese-language newspaper World Journal [xxvii] , describing his vision towards the Taiwan issue and supporting the US stance towards Taiwan. In one year of his presidency, despite strong resentment from China, President Biden invited Taiwan to the Summit of Democracy. [xxviii] The Taiwanese Vice President Lai Ching-te met the Vice President of the US briefly during the inauguration of new Honduras President Xiomara Castro. It was the first public meeting between the two Vice-Presidents since they took office. [xxix] Until now the Biden administration has provided arms sales to Taiwan twice. First, on 5 August 2021, the Biden administration agreed to a USD 750 million weapons sale to Taiwan. Second, on 8 February 2022, arm sales worth USD 100 million worth of equipment and services to support its air and missile defence systems to Taiwan. Soon after taking office, President Biden started sending warnings to China against any expansion in East and Southeast Asia. He reiterated that the US position on China\u2019s maritime claims remains the same as the 2016 Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s finding. The US has also rejected aggressive Chinese postures, exploitation of hydrocarbon and fisheries in the South China Sea. [xxx] Periodically, the US has been sending naval and air patrols challenging China's claims of sovereignty over the area and also asserting the freedom of navigation. In the last few years, the US has conducted many Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOP); one in 2015, three in 2016, four in 2017, six in 2018, eight in 2019, and nine in 2020 . [xxxi] President Biden showed no sign of backing down. In the first month in office, he sent two aircraft carrier strike groups for joint operation in the disputed region. [xxxii] Conclusion In the virtual meeting with President Biden, Xi Jinping has reiterated that the most important event in international relations in the coming 50 years will be for China and the US to find the right way to get along. On the other hand, after the virtual summit, President Biden said: \u201cLet\u2019s get something straight, we know each other well. We\u2019re not old friends. It\u2019s pure business.\u201d The contradiction in their perception of bilateral relations is evident. A few developments such as the release of t he CFO of Huawei, Meng Wanzhou from jail have taken place. But largely, the technology issue between the two sides remains complex. At the moment, the trajectory of the trade war appears to be uncertain. This year marks the 50 th anniversary of Richard M. Nixon\u2019s visit to China and the signing of the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9. China is using the occasion to warn the US to refrain from using Taiwan as a \u201cpoker chip\u201d and to remind of its commitments made in the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis Taiwan. Two delegations from the US have visited Taiwan. One delegation led by former US Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and the second led by Mike Pompeo. In the ongoing Ukraine crisis, US-China relations are becoming tenser. China has criticised the US position on the crisis and the chances are that US-China ties will become more antagonistic. President Biden and his administration are attempting a nuanced policy on China. They are making efforts to keep all channels of communication in place and the policies under him are becoming more competitive. To sum up, US-China relations are at a critical juncture and the second year of his presidency will be crucial for bilatera l relations. ***** *Dr. Teshu Singh is a Research Fellow at the Indian Council of World Affairs, New Delhi Disclaimer: Views expressed are personal.
