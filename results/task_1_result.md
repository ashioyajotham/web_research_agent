PET PRESIDENT XI: (As interpreted.) Can you put on your earpiece? We have simultaneous interpreting. PRESIDENT BIDEN: I\u2019ve learned to speak Chinese. (Laughter.) Wish I did. PRESIDENT XI: Okay, let me begin first. It\u2019s a great pleasure to see you again, President Biden. Over the past four years, China-U.S. relations have gone through ups and downs. But under our joint stewardship, the two sides have also been engaged in fruitful dialogue and cooperation, and the relationship has been kept stable on the whole. These developments reconfirmed the experiences and lessons of the past of 45 years of China-U.S. diplomatic ties. When the two countries treat each other as partner and friend, seek common ground while (inaudible) differences, and help each other succeed, our relationship would make considerable progress. But if we take each other as rival or adversary, pursue vicious competition, and seek to hurt each other, we would roil the relationship or even set it back. The world today is turbulent, plagued by conflicts. Old problems are compounded by new ones. Humanity is faced with unprecedented challenges. Major country competition should not be the underlying logic of the times. Only solidarity and cooperation can help humanity overcome current difficulties. In an age of flourishing sci-tech revolution, neither decoupling nor supply chain disruption is a solution. Only mutually beneficial cooperation can lead to common development. \u201cSmall yard, high fences\u201d is not what a major country should pursue. Only openness and sharing can improve the well-being of humanity. As two major countries, China and the United States should bear in mind the interests of the whole world and inject more certainty and positive energy into the turbulent world. It is my consistent belief that as the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship, a stable China-U.S. relationship is critical not only to the interests of the Chinese and American peoples, but also to the future and destiny of the entire humanity. The two countries should bear in mind the well-being of the two peoples and the common interests of the international community, make the wise choice, keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other, and realize the long-term peaceful coexistence of China and the United States on this planet. The United States has recently concluded its elections. China\u2019s goal of a stable, healthy, and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Our commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and winning cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Our position of resolutely safeguarding China\u2019s sovereignty, security, and development interests remains unchanged. Our desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged. China is ready to work with the new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation, and manage differences so as to strive for a steady transition of the China-U.S. relationship for the benefit of the two peoples. I look forward to an in-depth exchange of views with you on China-U.S. relations and on issues of mutual interest. Thank you. PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. It\u2019s good to see you and see all of you again. You know, one year ago, we met in the Woodside Summit in San Francisco. And I\u2019m very proud of the progress we\u2019ve both made together. On military communication, at multiple levels our leaders are now regularly talking to one another on a regular basis. On AI, we have brought together our nations\u2019 experts together to discuss risks and safety. Our counternarcotics \u2014 on that issue, we resumed cooperation. And I want to note: In my country, Mr. President, overdose deaths are coming down for the first time in five years. We have a lot to discuss, but let me close with this. Over \u2014 for over a decade, you and I have spent many hours together, both here and in China and in between. And, you know, we \u2014 I think we\u2019ve spent a long time \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 dealing with these issues. Let me close with this. We \u2014 I think \u2014 and I once had to count up the number of hours you and I spent alone together. I remember being on the Tibetan Plateau with you and I remember being in Beijing. I remember \u2014 all over the world. And \u2014 both as my \u2014 first as vice president, then as president. We haven\u2019t always agreed, but our conversations have always been candid and always been frank. We have never kidded one another. We\u2019ve been level with one another. And I think that\u2019s vital. These conversations prevent miscalculations, and they ensure the competition between our two countries will not veer into conflict \u2014 be competition, not conflict. And that\u2019s our responsibility to our people and, as you indicated, to the people around the world. We are the most important alliance or most important re- \u2014 relationship in the entire world. And how we get along together is going to impact the rest of the world. And \u2014 so, you know, our two countries cannot let any of this competition veer into conflict. And as I said, that\u2019s our responsibility. And over the last four years, I think we\u2019ve proven it\u2019s possible to have this relationship. And \u2014 but \u2014 so, Mr. President, I\u2019m anxious to get our meeting starting and discuss the issues we have remaining. Thank you. 4:14 P.M. PET President Joseph R.

EDT THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Now, I assume you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re standing in case you have to run when the rain starts. (Laughter.) Please, have a seat. Rox, thank you very much for all you do to fight for American steelworkers.\u00c2 I mean that sincerely.\u00c2 I \u2014 and I want to recognize all the labor unions here today, including Steel Workers, Auto Workers, Sheet Metal Workers, AFL-CIO, IBEW, Communications Workers, Boilermakers, Machinists. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud, as Rox said, to be labeled the most pro-union President in American history. You heard me say it before: Wall Street is important, lot of good folks there, but they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build America. The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class. Folks, leaders from key American industries are here as well, including steel, aluminum, solar, semiconductors, automakers. And members of my Cabinet are here as well. Janet Yellen \u2014 the front row is Murderers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Row here \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 the Treasury Department; Julie Su, our Trade \u2014 our \u2014 of \u2014 of Labor; and Katherine Tai, our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trade Representative; and outstanding members of Congress as well. From Michigan, Debbie Stabenow is here. Debbie, welcome. And Hala- \u2014 and Haley Stevens is here. No, I guess she \u2014 there you are. Oh, you did make it. They told me you might not be able to make it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry. REPRESENTATIVE STEVENS: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here. (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT: All right. And Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. Again, you \u2014 smile, Debbie, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay. (Laughter.) REPRESENTATIVE DINGELL: I am. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy. THE PRESIDENT: Elissa Slotkin \u2014 Well, you should be. You \u2014 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u2014 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re responsible for a lot of this. Thank you for joining us as I announce a series of actions to make sure American workers and American business and corporations can compete and win in the industries of the future, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what this is about. The fact is that American workers are \u2014 can outwork and outcompete anyone, as long as the competition is fair. But for too long, it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been fair. For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies across a whole range of industries: steel and aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, solar panels \u2014 the industries of the future \u2014 and even critical health equipment, like gloves and masks. China heavily subsidized all these products, pushing Chinese companies to produce far more than the rest of the world can absorb. And then dumping the excess products onto the market at unfairly low prices, driving other manufacturers around the world out of business. You know, we \u2014 I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into it, but we were talking about today about how many aluminum plants there used to be and how many there are now. The prices are unfairly low because Chinese companies don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to worry about a profit because the Chinese government subsidized them and subsidized them heavily. And the Chinese relies on other anticompetitive tactics as well, like forcing the American companies to transfer their technology in order to do business in China. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent a lot of time with Xi Jinping. Early on, I told him \u2014 he said, why am I being unfair with China? (Inaudible.) I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll play by the same rules if you want. If you want to do business in China, you got to have a 51 percent Chinese owner, you got to provide access to all your intellectual property, et cetera. You want to do that in America?\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was silence. Sometimes they just outright steal through cyber espionage and other means. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a well-documented inter- \u2014 and internationally recognized. When you make tactics like these, they are \u2014 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u2014 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not competing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not competition. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheating. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the damage here in America. To name one example, back in 2000, when cheap steel from China began to flood the market, U.S. steel towns across Pennsylvania and Ohio were hit hard. And any of you from those areas know well. More than 1,800 [18,000] ironworkers and steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Ohio lost their jobs. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to let that happen again. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why today I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m announcing new tariffs in key sectors of the economy that are going to ensure that our workers are not held back by unfair trade practices. They include a thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m announcing today: 25 percent tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum products. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll counter China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overcapacity in these industries. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making major investments in clean American steel and aluminum \u2014 clean American steel and aluminum. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big deal. Clean because of the way we manufacture it here \u2014 it emits half as much carbon as steel made in China. Last month, my administration announced the largest investment in clean manufacturing in all of history, up to $1.5 billion in six clean steel projects across America, creating and supporting thousands \u2014 thousands of union jobs. Next, a 100 percent tariff on electric vehicles made in China. And people say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Applause.) Because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to let China flood our market, making it impossible for American automakers \u2014 automobile \u2014 auto manufacturers to compete fairly. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also implementing a 25 percent tariff on electric vehicle batteries from China and a 25 percent tariff on the critical minerals that make those batteries. Folks, look, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m determined that the future of the electric vehicles will be made in America by union workers.\u00c2 Period.\u00c2 (Applause.)\u00c2 And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do it by following international trade laws to do it.\u00c2 American companies are investing tens of billions of dollars in electric vehicles and their batteries. And thanks to my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building a network of 500,000 charging stations all across America, creating thousands \u2014 thousands of IBEW jobs across America. Electric charging stations \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and the reason to do this is simple: Electric charging stations have to be as easy to find as a gas station, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what this will be. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to have to worry about \u2014 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking off and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be able to make it all across the country in one \u2014 without having to figure something else out. Our partners around the world are making similar investments. They also want a supply chain for electric vehicles that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dominated by unfair trade practices from China. America can continue to buy \u2014 Americans \u2014 I want to make this clear, notwithstanding what the other guy is saying \u2014 can buy any kind of car they want \u2014 whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gas, electric, or hybrid \u2014 but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never going to allow China to fa- \u2014 unfairly control the market for these cars. Period. Next \u2014 (applause) \u2014 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to raise tariffs on Chinese solar panels from 25 to 50 percent.\u00c2 Here, again, because the Chinese government is subsidizing excess capacity, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re flooding the market.\u00c2 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re driving manufacturing companies out of business in Europe.\u00c2 But we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let that happen here in America. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re putting a 50 percent tariff on semiconductors made in China.\u00c2 These are those tiny computer \u2014 all of you know this, but for the public \u2014 those little, tiny computer chips, smaller than a fingertip, that power everyday lives \u2014 everything from smartphones to automobiles to dishwashers, satellites.\u00c2 Look, America invented these cheeps [chips]. But over time, we stopped making them. We invested other \u2014 overseas. Now, thanks to my CHIPS and Science Act, one of the most significant investments ever in science and technology, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing this vital industry back home where it started, in the United States of America. (Applause.) And finally, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re putting tariffs on health equipment, like masks and gloves that nurses and doctors wear every single day. If the pandemic caught us any- \u2014 tau- \u2014 taught us anything, we need a secure ply- \u2014 supply of essential supplies here at home. Folks, these key sectors, my administration is combining investments in America with tariffs that are strategic and targeted. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a smart approach. Compare that to the pri- \u2014 what the prior administration did. The \u2014 my predecessor promised to increase American exports and boost manufacturing. But he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t either. He failed. He signed a trade deal with China. They were supposed to buy $200 billion more in American goods. Instead, China imports from America barely budged. And now, Trump and his MAGA Republicans want across-the-board tariffs on all imports from all countries, if reelected. Well, that would drive up costs for families on an average of $1,500 per year each year. He simply doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it. For years, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard many Republicans and even Democratic friends say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is not on the rise\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 excuse me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is on the rise; America is falling behind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always believed they got it wrong. America is rising. We have the best economy in the world. And since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come into office, the GDP is up, our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest level in over a decade, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re standing up against Chinese government unfair economic practices now. At the same time \u2014 (applause) \u2014 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve revitalized our partnerships with the Pacific allies in India, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines \u2014 Pacific Island nations. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made sure the most advanced American technologies we develop or invent can be used by the Chi- \u2014 can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be used by the Chinese government to undermine our national security. Frankly, before it rains \u2014 frankly, for all this tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that. Bottom line: I want fair competition with China, not conflict. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a stronger position to win that economic competition of the 21st century against China than anyone else because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing in America again. Let me close \u2014 let me close with this. I come from Scranton, a town like a lot of working-class, middle-class neighborhoods all across America \u2014 like Racine, Wisconsin, which I visited last week. Once a manufacturing boomtown until trickle-down economics came along, and the middle class in Racine got hollowed out. Six years ago, my predecessor showed up carrying a golden shovel, promising, thanks to his new $10 billion, manufacturing complex would be built in Racine. He said it would be the eighth wonder of the world \u2014 big promises that never came true. He used that golden shovel to dig a hole, and then he fell into it. (Laughter.) Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not on my \u2014 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not part of my \u2014 well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m delivering for Racine \u2014 delivering. Thanks to the investment of my administration, Microsoft is investing billions to build a new data center in Racine, creating thousands of good-paying jobs. Because the view from Scranton and towns like it are a lot different than from Mar-a-Lago. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the view where \u2014 that money doesn\u2019t determine your worth, everyone is entitled to being treated with dignity and respect, and everyone deserves a fair shot. We leave nobody behind. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the America we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building together. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been more optimistic about our future. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really going fast because of the rain. We have \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we have to remember who we are. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the United States of America. (Applause.) And there is nothing \u2014 there is nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. God bless you all. And better get out of the rain. Thank you very, very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Oh, we got to sign this. Q Mr. President, why wait three years for the tariffs? (The presidential memorandum is signed.) THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Q Mr. President \u2014 Q Mr. President, is Netanyahu going too far in Rafah? Q Mr. President, Trump said today, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is eating our lunch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What do you say in response? He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is eating our lunch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what Trump said today. THE PRESIDENT: He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being feeding them a long time.

Advertisement The meeting lasted more than 3\u00bd hours, and statements issued by both sides described it as a candid exchange. Here are some of the main points each leader raised, based on readouts from the Chinese foreign ministry and the White House. Xi Jinping: \u201cIn the next 50 years, the most important thing in international relations is that China and the United States must find the right way to get along.\u201d \u201cSuch moves are extremely dangerous, just like playing with fire. Whoever plays with fire will get burnt,\u201d Xi said of US involvement in the Taiwan Strait. \u201cIf the \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 separatist forces provoke or cross our red line, we will have to take decisive measures.\u201d \u201cWe are willing to engage in dialogue on human rights issues on the basis of mutual respect, but we do not approve of interfering in other countries\u2019 internal affairs through human rights issues.\u201d \u201cThe US should stop abusing or overstretching the concept of national security to suppress Chinese businesses. It is imperative for China and the US to maintain communication on macroeconomic policies, support world economic recovery and guard against ... risks.\u201d \u201cAs the leader of China, I can serve the 1.4 billion Chinese people, and together, create a better life with them ... My attitude is, \u2018I shall put aside my own well-being and live up to people\u2019s expectations\u2019.\u201d Chinese President Xi Jinping, in Beijing, during the virtual meeting on Tuesday. Photo: Xinhua Joe Biden : \u201cOur responsibility as leaders of China and the United States is to ensure that the competition between our countries does not veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended. Just simple, straightforward competition.\u201d \u201cWe need to establish some common sense guardrails, to be clear and honest where we disagree, and work together where our interests intersect, especially on vital global issues like climate change .\u201d \u201cWe have a responsibility to the world, as well as to our people. It\u2019s why we believe \u2026 all countries have to play by the same rules of the road, why the United States is always going to stand up for our interests and values and those of our allies and partners.\u201d Biden \u201cunderscored that the United States remains committed to the one-China policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three joint communiques and the six assurances, and that the United States strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait\u201d, according to the White House readout. He also emphasised that the US \u201cwill continue to stand up for its interests and values and, together with our allies and partners, ensure the rules of the road for the 21st century advance an international system that is free, open and fair\u201d.

ICT THE PRESIDENT: Good evening, everyone. It is evening, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? (Laughter.) This around the world in five days is interesting, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? Well, you know, there is that \u2014 one of my staff members said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemember the famous song, you know, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Good Morning, Vietnam\u00e2\u0080\u0099?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well, good evening, Vietnam. And good morning back in America. Before we begin, I want to express my sadness by the loss of life and devastation caused by the earthquake in Morocco. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Morocco and my friend King Mohammed VII \u2014 VI, I should say. And his admini- \u2014 my administration \u2014 including Secretary of State Blinken, who is here with me today \u2014 is working with Moroccan officials on long distance here. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working expeditiously to ensure American citizens in Morocco are safe, standing ready to provide any necessary assistance to the Moroccan people as well. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made that offer. Now, turning to the important visit here in Vietnam. As the General Secretary and I just shared earlier today, this trip has been a historic moment. Today, we can trace 50-year \u2014 a 50-year arc of progress in the relationship between our nations from conflict to normalization. This is a new elevated status that will be a force for prosperity and security in one of the most consequential regions in the world. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve elevated our cooperation directly to the Vietnamese\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest tier of partnership, referred to as the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. That means the United States has strengthened our ties with another critical Indo-Pacific partner. Our progress today builds on the Camp David trilateral with Japan and \u2014 and the Republic of Korea and the United States; the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership the United States launched with \u2014 with ASEAN last year; and the engagement with Pacific Islands \u2014 with the Pacific Islands Forum; our strengthened alliances with the Philippines; and AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom; our elevated Quad engagement with India, Australia, and Japan; and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity; and all the effort we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve advanced from day one of my administration to demonstrate to our Indo-Pacific partners and to the world that the United States is a Pacific nation, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going anywhere. Now, let me also speak to a significant business we got done in the In- \u2014 in India during the G20 Summit. This was an important moment for the United States to demonstrate our global leadership and our commitment to solving the challenges that matter most to people around the world: investing in inclusive growth and sustainable development, addressing the climate crisis, strengthening food security and education, advancing global health and health security. We showed up ready to work, and we showed the world the United States is a partner with a positive vision for our shared future. As a G20, we \u2014 at the G20, we made progress on issues like multilateral development bank reform to get to those nations that are neither poor nor wealthy but were \u2014 couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t qualify before; debt relief; and increased infrastructure needs not only in the Global South, but other parts of the world as well. We forged a groundbreaking new partnership with \u2014 that will connect India to Europe with the Middle East and Israel, with transportation by rail and by shipment through \u2014 and energy supplies and digital connections that are going to open up untold opportunities for transformative economic investment through that en- \u2014 on that entire corridor. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also discussed Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brutal and illegal war in Ukraine. And there was sufficient agreement in the room on the need for a just \u2014 for a just and lasting peace that upholds the principles of the U.N. Charter and respects sovereignty and territorial integrity. I want to, once again, thank Prime Minister Modi for his leadership and his hospitality in hosting the G20. He and I have had a substantial discussions about how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to continue to strengthen the partnership between India and the United States, building on the Prime Minister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit to the White House last June. And, as I always do, I raised the important \u2014 of respecting human rights and the vital role that civil society and a free press have in building a strong and prosperous country with Mr. Modi. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u2014 have gotten a lot of important work done, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking forward to another good day tomorrow here in Vietnam. And now, I will take your questions. Let me see. They told me \u2014 they gave me five people here. Nandita of \u2014 of Reuters. Q Hi. Thank you for taking my question, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Oh, there you are. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u2014 Q Hi. THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 see you. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry. Q Hi. Last week, China questioned the, quote, \u00e2\u0080\u009csincerity\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the Biden administration. THE PRESIDENT: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, the what? Q The sincerity. THE PRESIDENT: The sincerity of the Biden administration. Q Of the Biden administration. And accused the United States of containing China while pushing for diplomatic talks. How would you respond to that? And do you think President Xi is being sincere about getting the relationship back on track as he bans Apple in China? THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, first of all, the \u2014 I am sincere about getting the relationship right. And one of the things that is going on now is China is beginning to change some of the rules of the game, in terms of trade and other issues. And so, one of the things we talked about, for example, is that they\u2019re now talking about making sure that no Chinese employ- \u2014 no one in the Chinese government can use a Western cell phone. Those kinds of things. And so, really, what this trip was about \u2014 it was less about containing China. I \u2014 I don\u2019t want to contain China. I just want to make sure that we have a relationship with China that is on the up and up, squared away, everybody knows what it\u2019s all about. And one of the ways you do that is you make sure that we are talking about the same things. And I think that one of the things we\u2019ve done \u2014 I\u2019ve tried to do, and I\u2019ve talked with a number of my staff about this for the last, I guess, six months \u2014 is \u2014 we have an opportunity to strengthen alliances around the world to maintain stability. That\u2019s what this trip was all about: having India cooperate much more with the United States, be closer with the United States, Vietnam being closer with the United States. It\u2019s not about containing China; it\u2019s about having a stable base \u2014 a stable base in the Indo-Pacific. And it\u2019s \u2014 for example, when I was spending a lot of time talking with President Xi, he asked why we were doing \u2014 why was I going to have the Quad \u2014 meaning Australia, India, Japan, and the United States? And I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo maintain stability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u2019s not about isolating China. It\u2019s about making sure the rules of the road \u2014 everything from airspace and \u2014 and space and in the ocean is \u2014 the international rules of the road are \u2014 are \u2014 are abided by. And so \u2014 and I hope that \u2014 I think that Prime Minister Xi \u2014 I mean, Xi has some \u2014 some difficulties right now. All countries end up with difficulties, and he had some economic difficulties he\u2019s working his way through. I \u2014 I want to see China succeed economically, but I want to see them succeed by the rules. The next question was to Bloomberg. Q Hi, Mr. President. Following up on your comments on China and the economy, you recently called China\u2019s economy a \u00e2\u0080\u009cticking time bomb.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Do you believe the country\u2019s slowdown could risk destabilizing the global economy or causing China to be more aggressive defensively, including with \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Say the first part of your question again. Because there \u2014 this fan is going on, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loud behind me. Q No worries. Do you believe the country\u2019s slowdown and growth could risk destabilizing the global economy or cause China to be more aggressive defensively, including with Taiwan? And separately, sir, are you worried about the meeting between President Putin and Kim Jong Un, if that could mean Russia has more gains in the war in Ukraine? THE PRESIDENT: Look, I think China has a difficult economic problem right now for a whole range of reasons that relate to the international growth and lack thereof and the \u2014 the policies that China has followed. And so, I \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to cause China to invade Taiwan. And matter of fact, the opposite \u2014 it probably doesn\u2019t have the \u2014 the same capacity that it had before. But as I said, I\u2019m not \u2014 we\u2019re not looking to hurt China, sincerely. We\u2019re all better off if China does well \u2014 if China does well by the international rules. It grows the economy. But they have had some real difficulty in terms of their economy of late, particularly in real estate. Asi- \u2014 that end of the bargain. And I think the actions that they\u2019re going to have to take are ones that are \u2014 they\u2019re in the process of deciding right now. And I\u2019m not going to predict what \u2014 what \u2014 what way it will come out. But we\u2019re not looking to decouple from China. What I\u2019m not going to do is I\u2019m not going to sell China material that would enhance their capacity to make more nuclear weapons, to engage in defense activities that are contrary to what is viewed as most people would think was a positive development in the region. And \u2014 but we\u2019re not trying to hurt China. Okay. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u2014 BBC. Laura? Am I correct? Is that correct \u2014 Laura? Q It is. My name is Laura Bicker. I\u2019m from BBC News. Good evening, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Good evening. Q How are you? THE PRESIDENT: Well. Thank you. Q Good. THE PRESIDENT: These five-day trips around the world are no problem. Q I can imagine. It is evening, I\u2019d like to remind you. (Laughter.) I mean, in the last six months, you\u2019ve signed pacts and deals with Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Australia, and even the Pacific Islands. You\u2019re here, standing in Beijing\u2019s backyard. You know, China says this is part of your Cold War mentality. Are they right, sir? Are they right, Mr. President? Is it a danger of a Cold War? And when will you meet Mr. Xi? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I hope I get to see Mr. Xi sooner than later. I\u2019ve spent more time with him than any other world leader has, sum total, over the last 12 years. So, I hope we get to see him again soon. But, no, look \u2014 for example, one of the things we did in \u2014 in India: We provided for a new path that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to save everybody money, increase the Third World \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Third World\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 the \u2014 the Global South\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity to grow by sending \u2014 we\u2019re going to \u2014 from \u2014 we\u2019re going to have a new railroad from India all the way across to the Mediterranean, new shipping lanes and pipelines across the Mediterranean through Europe, up into \u2014 up into Great Britain and beyond. That\u2019s all about economic growth. That has nothing to do with hurting China or helping China. It has to do with dealing with everything from climate change to making sure that these countries can succeed economically and grow. Look, my thesis has been, from the beginning, both domestically and in \u2014 in terms of foreign policy: Invest in your people. Invest in the people. Give them a chance. Everything is better off when people \u2014 I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to sound trite. If everybody in the world had a job they get up in the morning and wanted to go to and thought they \u2014 and they could put three squares in the table for their family, no matter where they live, the whole world be better off. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be a lot better. That\u2019s the notion here behind this. For example, you know, one of the things we\u2019re doing in terms of \u2014 I \u2014 I proposed a long time ago at the G7, now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u2014 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to come to fruition at the G20, is making sure that we build a railroad all the way across the African continent. Think about it. There is no way to cross the African continent by ro- \u2014 by \u2014 by rail. And there\u2019s not even a direct highway across. Now, let\u2019s assume for the sake of discussion \u2014 when we talk about food shortages \u2014 assume there was one country in that vast continent that had a \u2014 an excess of \u2014 of foodstuffs and resources. How would they get it to where they\u2019re going to go? How are they going to do it? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u2019re also going to invest billions of dollars in solar facilities in Angola to have the largest an- \u2014 the largest solar facility in the world \u2014 among the largest. That helps Angola, but it also helps the whole region. So, I think we think too \u2014 too much in terms of Cold War terms. It\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about generating economic growth and stability in all parts of the world. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. Sorry. Okay. Am I pronouncing it \u2014 Auvelia [Aurelia]? Did I pronounce the name correctly? There you are. Q Yes. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Q It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Aurelia End for AFP. I had a question on the climate crisis. You just mentioned the G20. Just this week, the United States warned that if there is no phasing out of fossil fuels, it won\u2019t be possible to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. There was no agreement at the G20 on fossil fuels. How concerned are you about this lack of consensus? THE PRESIDENT: It wasn\u2019t so much an agreement that we would try to meet the goals at the G20. The United States is going to meet those goals, by the way. We\u2019re going to exceed those goals. A lot of other countries are as well. But we want to give those countries that don\u2019t have the economic wherewithal and did not cause the problem in the first place \u2014 for example, I met with Lula in Brazil. I started off way back in the \u00e2\u0080\u009880s with a fairly fine Republican senator named Dick Lugar. We said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. If you owe us money, we\u2019re going to forgive your debt if you maintain your forest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Because they become carbon sinks. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the things that take carbon out of the air. And so, we\u2019re talking to what we should be go \u2014 and the countries that cleared their land and put cattle on there and farming and \u2014 and did all the things that \u2014 and increased development, they, in fact, are the ones \u2014 the reasons why \u2014 the main reason why we\u2019ve gotten as far down the road to disaster here as we have. And so, it seems \u2014 and if we have the economic capacity, we \u2014 those nations should be getting together and providing help for the nations that don\u2019t have the wherewithal to do it \u2014 the economic wherewithal and the infrastructure wherewithal. And that\u2019s why, for example, I mentioned \u2014 in the interest of time, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just mention Angola again. Angola has the capacity to generate megawatts of energy through solar energy. They don\u2019t have the \u2014 the economic means to do that. Isn\u2019t it in the interest of the whole world if they are, in fact, able to generate significant capacity to absorb \u2014 to prevent carbon from being released in the air? I think that it is. So, what we\u2019re trying to do is help those nations. The \u2014 and particularly in the Global South, where they\u2019re not as wealthy, where there are not as many opportunities to be able to deal with the things that they want to deal with. For example \u2014 and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll end with this \u2014 there is more carbon absor- \u2014 absorbed from the atmosphere on a daily basis \u2014 and I\u2019ll look to my \u2014 my friend, John Kerry, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d forgotten more about this than most people know \u2014 correct me if I get this wrong, John, but I\u2019m quite sure I\u2019m right \u2014 and that is that there\u2019s more carbon observed [absorbed] from the air into the Amazon region into the ground \u2014 the ground \u2014 than emitted in the entire United States on the same basis. Now, imagine if people go in and do what we did 150, 200, 250 years ago and cut down the forest and the \u2014 start farming in that area, no longer have that great carbon sink. We \u2014 you know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going \u2014 it would be a gigantic problem. So, we should be going to areas, whether it\u2019s in the Congo or other places, as \u2014 as the G7 nations and as the wealthy G20 nations, the \u2014 and providing the kind of infrastructure they need to be able to benefit. And guess what? In addition to helping the environment overall \u2014 and the only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a \u2014 than a nuclear war is global warming going above 1.5 degrees in the next 20 \u2014 10 years. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u2014 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be real trouble. There\u2019s no way back from that. And so, there\u2019s a lot we can do in the meantime. For example, that \u2014 that pipeline \u2014 that railroad we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about going across from the middle \u2014 from India, throughout the Middle East, and to \u2014 across the Mediterranean and all through Europe, that\u2019s going to have a hydrogen pipeline there. This is going to significantly reduce the amount of carbon emitted in the air, but it costs a lot of money to put that down. And the world is going to say it\u2019s in our interest \u2014 collective interest to do it. So, I have not \u2014 I have not given up at all on the notion that we\u2019re going to be able to, you know \u2014 how can I say it? I \u2014 I think \u2014 I think we can triple the renewable capacity for \u2014 as it relates to global warming \u2014 by the year 20- \u2014 2030 \u2014 2030. Countries following the IRA playbook, which is the one we passed \u2014 the clean energy jobs, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to create manufacturing jobs. For example, as a consequence of what we\u2019ve done, we \u2014 we have the most \u2014 we have the most e- \u2014 we have the strongest economy in the world today. Right now, today, the United States of America has the strongest economy in the world \u2014 in the world. Now, we\u2019ve got more to do, but we have the strongest economy in the world. And one of the reasons we\u2019re doing it \u2014 we changed the mechanism of how we deal with this. And that is instead of trickle-down economy \u2014 that is if the wealthy and the corporations do very well, everybody is going to do well. Well, the truth of the matter is: I\u2019ve never bought that theory. But I think the times have changed, and a lot of leading economists are beginning to agree with me \u2014 just flat, straight-out academic economists \u2014 and that is: We should build economic growth from the middle out and the bottom up. When that happens, everybody does well. Everybody does well. The wealthy still do very, very well. They have no problem. You can still be a billionaire under that system as well. But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to start paying your taxes if I have anything to do it. That\u2019s a different issue. But all kidding aside \u2014 so, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u2014 we have \u2014 I think the other thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dawning on people \u2014 many of you who are e- \u2014 foreign policy experts have been engaged for a long time. Did you ever think you\u2019d be sitting at a G20 conference where everyone was preoccupied with the notion of global warming? Not a joke. Did you ever think that? And there\u2019s a \u2014 my \u2014 my brother loves having \u2014 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s famous lines from movies that he always quotes. You know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u2014 and one \u2014 one of them is \u2014 there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s a movie about John Wayne. He\u2019s an Indian scout. And they\u2019re trying to get the Ap- \u2014 I think it was the Apache \u2014 one \u2014 one of the great tribes of America back on the reservation. And he\u2019s standing with a Union so- \u2014 so he\u2019s \u2014 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all on their \u2014 and they\u2019re on their horses in their saddles. And there\u2019s three or four Indians in headdresses, and the Union soldiers \u2014 and the Union soldiers are basically saying to the Indians, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome with me, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take care of you. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll \u2014 everything will be good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the Indian scou- \u2014 the Indian looks at John Wayne and points to the Union soldier and says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lying, dog-faced pony soldier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of lying, dog-faced pony soldiers out there about \u2014 about global warming, but not anymore. All of a sudden, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all realizing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing like seeing the light. For \u2014 and let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just following my orders here. Staff, is there anybody I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoken to? (Cross-talk.) THE PRESIDENT: No, I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t calling on you. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m calling on \u2014 I said there were five questions. MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Anita \u2014 Anita from VOA. THE PRESIDENT: Anita from VOA. Q Thank you, Mr. President. I hope you didn\u2019t think that calling only on woman would get you softballs tonight. (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I know better than that. Q Okay. Well, let me start with President Xi \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: If you send me a softball, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to do with it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably strike out even worse. Q Well, let me ask you about \u2014 you \u2014 you\u2019ve spent lots of time talking about all the time you spent with President Xi and the importance of leader-to-leader communication, yet you two haven\u2019t spoken in 10 months. And I just wonder, are you worried that this is destabilizing the U.S.-China relationship? And what are you going to do about it? And then, if I may on Ukraine, sir. Kyiv is ups- \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) Q \u2014 is upset that the G20 communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 didn\u2019t named Russia as the aggressor. Have you managed to rally more support or sympathy across the G20, or is this emerging as a wedge issue with the Global South? And does that change your commitment to Ukraine? THE PRESIDENT: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a wedge issue of the Global South. It\u2019s a wedge issue with Russia, which was present, and with China, which was present \u2014 which was \u2014 had the representation. And so \u2014 and, by the way, I am a \u2014 my \u2014 my team, my staff still meets with President Xi\u2019s people and his Cabinet, and, in effect, I met with his number-two person here in \u2014 excuse me, in India today. So, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a \u2014 a crisis if I don\u2019t personally speak to him. It would be better if I did, but I think \u2014 Look, this is not a criticism; it\u2019s an observation: He has his hands full right now. He has overwhelming unemployment with his youth. One of the major economic tenets of his plan isn\u2019t working at all right now. I\u2019m not happy for that. But it\u2019s not working. So, he\u2019s trying to figure out, I suspect \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 just like I would, trying to figure out what to do about the particular crisis they\u2019re having now. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a crisis relating to conflict between China and the United States. As a matter of fact, I think it\u2019s less likely to cause that kind of conflict. I don\u2019t \u2014 Anyway, I just think that there are other things on leaders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 minds, and they respond to what\u2019s needed at the time. And look, nobody likes having celebrated international meetings if you don\u2019t know what you want at the meeting, if you don\u2019t have a gameplan. He may have a gameplan; he just hasn\u2019t shared it with me. But I tell you what, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about you, but I\u2019m going to go to bed. Q What did you talk about with Mr. Li? You said you spoke to the number two from China, who wa- \u2014 in India today? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, we ta- \u2014 Q What did you talk about with him? THE PRESIDENT: We talked about what we talked about at the conference overall. We talked about stability. We talked about making sure that the Third World \u2014 the \u2014 excuse me \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThird World\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the Southern Hemisphere had access to change, it had access \u2014 We \u2014 it wasn\u2019t confrontational at all. He came up to me. He said (inaudible) \u2014 MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank \u2014 thank you, everybody. THE PRESIDENT: Thank \u2014 MS. JEAN-PIERRE: This ends the cou- \u2014 press conference. Thanks, everyone. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. (Cross-talk.) Q Mr. President, are you putting U.S. strategic interests above human rights here in Vietnam? Q You have time for one more. We came all this way. We came all this way. Q Are you putting U.S. strategic interests above human rights here in Vietnam? THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible) above human rights, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve raised it with every person I met with. Thank you. 9:34 P.M.

He added that the country\u2019s economic woes had left President Xi Jinping with \u201chis hands full right now\u201d. The president\u2019s remarks came after a meeting with Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of Vietnam\u2019s ruling Communist party, in the nation\u2019s capital designed to secure global supply chains of semiconductors and critical minerals, which would offer a strategic alternative to China . \u201cI think we have an enormous opportunity,\u201d Biden said of the visit. \u201cVietnam and the United States are critical partners at what I would argue is a very critical time.\u201d G20: battle for influence as US seeks to rival China in the global south Read more The meeting came during a multi-front diplomatic push to shore up international support for Ukrainian resistance to Russia\u2019s invasion and enunciate a policy toward China that both encourages trade and reduces the potential for US-Chinese conflict. The complexities of the administration\u2019s approach were illustrated on Saturday, a day before Biden landed in Hanoi, when the New York Times reported that Vietnam was in talks with Russia over a new arms supply deal that could trigger US sanctions. Reuters said it had seen \u2013 but could not authenticate \u2013 documents describing talks for a credit facility that Russia would extend to Vietnam to buy heavy weaponry, including anti-ship missiles, anti-submarine aircraft and helicopters, anti-aircraft missile systems and fighter jets. Earlier, at the G20 summit in New Delhi, India , western leaders failed to reiterate an explicit condemnation of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The summit declaration referred only to the \u201cwar in Ukraine\u201d and lamented the \u201csuffering\u201d of the Ukrainian people \u2013 an equivocation that indicates a growing lack of international consensus. Less than a year ago, G20 leaders issued a strong condemnation of the Russian invasion and called on Moscow to withdraw its forces. View image in fullscreen Joe Biden waves to children after a military welcome ceremony at the presidential palace in Hanoi, Vietnam, on 10 September 2023. Photograph: Luong Thai Linh/AP Biden\u2019s secretary of state, Antony Blinken , attempted to smooth over the disparity, telling ABC\u2019s This Week that world leaders meeting in New Delhi had \u201cstood up very clearly, including in the statement, for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d. Blinken said that virtually every meeting participant \u201cis intent on making sure there is a just and durable end to this Russian aggression\u201d. It was clear in the room, he said, that \u201ccountries are feeling the consequences and want the Russian aggression to stop\u201d. The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said: \u201cThe vast majority of G20 countries have supported multiple UN resolutions that call out Russia\u2019s illegal aggression.\u201d Jean-Pierre said the New Delhi communique \u201cbuilds on that, to send an unprecedented, unified statement on the imperative that Russia refrain from using force for territorial acquisition, abide by its obligations in the UN charter, and cease attacks on civilians and infrastructure\u201d. The comments came as a CBS News poll found only one in four Americans think Biden is improving the US\u2019s global position. According to the survey, 24% thought Biden was making the US stronger, 50% said weaker and 26% that he was not having much effect. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked if the Biden administration was being \u201ctoo easy\u201d on China, 57% agreed. On CNN, the Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley slammed the Biden administration\u2019s policy toward China, describing the country as an \u201cenemy\u201d. \u201cChina has practically been preparing for war with us for years,\u201d Haley said. \u201cYes, I view China as an enemy.\u201d Haley said China had bought 400,000 acres (162,000 hectares) of US soil and the largest pork producer in the country, and continues to steal $600bn a year in intellectual property while spreading propaganda. She pointed to Chinese drones used by US law enforcement and to the crisis caused by Chinese-sourced fentanyl that \u201chad killed more Americans than the Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam war combined\u201d. \u201cHow much more has to happen for Biden to realize you don\u2019t send cabinet members over to China to appease them?\u201d she said, referring to the recent visit of the US commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, to Beijing. The administration\u2019s effort to present a coherent picture of US foreign policy toward its two most vexing issues \u2013 China and Russia \u2013 continued Sunday with Vice-President Kamala Harris telling CBS News that a planned meeting between North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin \u201cwould be a huge mistake\u201d. \u201cWhen you look at Russia\u2019s unprovoked war on Ukraine, and the idea that they would supply ammunition to Russia \u2013 well, it\u2019s predictable where that ends up,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI also believe very strongly that for both Russia and North Korea, this will further isolate them.\u201d Harris also spoke to an emerging concern that China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, who skipped the G20, may decline to attend the Asia-Pacific economic cooperation leaders\u2019 meeting in San Francisco, California, in November. Last week, China\u2019s security agency hinted that a meeting between Xi and Biden in San Francisco would depend on the US \u201cshowing sufficient sincerity\u201d. China\u2019s ministry of state security said that the country \u201cwill never let its guard down\u201d. The comments came after Raimondo said the US did not want to decouple from China but that American companies had complained to her that China had become \u201cuninvestible\u201d. Asked how important it was for Xi Jinping to come to America, Harris remarked that \u201cit is important to the \u2026 stability of things that we keep open lines of communication\u201d.

  "extracted_text": "Biden and Xi discuss US-China cooperation and conflict Skip to content British Broadcasting Corporation Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather Newsletters Biden and Xi discuss US-China cooperation and conflict 2 April 2024 Share Save Kayla Epstein BBC News Share Save Getty Images US President Joe Biden greets Chinese President Xi Jinping at last November's APEC summit. US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a call on Tuesday in an effort to keep tensions between the two countries at a simmer. They discussed avenues of co-operation, including recent shared efforts to combat climate change and narcotics, according to summaries of the call. But there was significant disagreement on Taiwan and economic issues. Mr Biden stressed support for Taiwan, but Mr Xi called US interference in the South China Sea a \"red line\". Mr Xi also took issue with sanctions the US has put on China and Chinese-owned companies, calling it an \"endless stream of measures to suppress China's economy, trade, science and technology\". \"If the United States insists on suppressing China's high-tech development and depriving China of its legitimate right to development, we will not sit idly by,\" the Chinese leader said, according to a state media summary. Despite the areas of disagreement, the White House and Chinese state media described the conversation as \"candid and constructive\". The conversation ranged from AI concerns to military communications. \"I look forward to responsibly managing our relationship in the weeks and months ahead,\" Mr Biden wrote on X, formerly Twitter, after acknowledging points of tensions. While the discussion did not significantly alter the status of the countries' relationship, experts said that may not be the point. The call was \"largely performative and an attempt to show the rest of the world that in fact the countries are committed to managing the relationship well - even though the negative dynamics in the relationship has not changed,\" Robert Daly, director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, said. But that does not mean that the divisions expressed on the call, which lasted an hour and 45 minutes, were inconsequential. Mr Xi stressed that Washington's support of Taiwan and pursuit of sanctions against China was \"not 'risk reduction' but risk creation\", the summary says. President Biden did not shrink from his administration's backing of the Taiwanese government, according to the White House summary. The American president stressed the US view that it was essential to maintain \"peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait\" and \"the rule of law and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea\". But Mr Biden also challenged Mr Xi on China's continued support for Russia's defence industrial base, its trade policies, and national security threats to the United States, the White House readout said. \"For China, there is no other issue more important than Taiwan,\" Yun Sun, senior fellow and co-director of the East Asia programme at the Stimson Center, said of the call. \"But for the US, there are other issues as well.\" US and China agree to resume military communications Taiwan just chose a president China loathes. What now? Five things we learned from the Biden-Xi meeting Mr Daly emphasised that despite both readouts placing a focus on co-operation and conversation, \"this is not a sign of a thaw\" between the two superpowers. \"Both leaders have an interest in demonstrating responsible management of what they both know can be a very contentious relationship in the long term,\" Mr Daly said. This is all about damage control and doing what you can,\" he added. \"But neither leader is looking for an opening to change the tenor of the relationship.\" The two presidents previously met in November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in San Francisco, California, where they agreed to address climate change and fentanyl trafficking. The meeting was widely viewed as an effort to cool tensions between Beijing and Washington after an American warplane shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon off the US coast last year. The two leaders' discussion, which the White House said again touched on climate change and drug trafficking, comes ahead of several events that could prove crucial to US-China relationship. Next month, Taiwan will inaugurate its president-elect, William Lai Ching-te, whom Beijing has called a \"troublemaker\" and \"separatist.\" The event probably loomed over the Biden-Xi call, said Ms Sun. \"The inauguration of the Taiwan president is coming up, so there is a need for China to emphasise that the US must tread carefully,\" she said. There are several key diplomatic meetings for the US and China on the horizon. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will soon visit China - after an American business delegation met Mr Xi last week - and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to make a trip in the coming weeks.

It is one of the most challenging foreign policy relationship that President Biden inherited from his predecessor. In his first press conference, President Biden said: \u201cThis is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21 st century and autocracies.\u201d He further said: \u201cWe have got to prove democracy works.\u201d To a large extent, the issues of friction have remained the same as those under Donald Trump. Against this background the paper analyzes the developments in the US-China relations under the Biden administration. While addressing the Congress, in his first speech to Congress, President Biden assured the maintenance of a strong US military presence in the Indo-Pacific and promised to boost technological development and trade. \u201cChina and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future.\u201d [i] It may be noted, the day President Biden assumed office, China imposed sanctions on the outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other 27 officials for their posture towards China. This was meant to intimidate the new government. [ii] President Joe Biden and Xi Jinping had the first virtual meeting on 16 November 2021. (Earlier, the leaders had spoken twice.) The meeting lasted for three and a half-hour. The two leaders discussed issues of trade, Taiwan and human rights. Both sides issued separate statements listing their concerns. There was no major outcome of the meeting nor was there any joint statement. [iii] Xi Jinping laid out three principles and four priority areas for the China-US relations. [iv] However, there were no similar statements from the US side. US-China trade friction marks a highly contested aspect of bilateral relations. While speaking to the United Steelworkers in May 2020, President Biden had said: \u201cI will use tariffs when they are needed, but the difference between me and Trump is that I will have a strategy-a plan \u2013to use those tariffs to win, not just to fake toughness\u201d. [v] The US new approach to the US-China bilateral trade relationship was articulated by US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai at the CSIS. [vi] Her remarks at CSIS indicated that the US is looking forward to assessing and discussing the \u201cPhase One\u201d trade agreement signed under Donald Trump in January 2020, launching a new review process to look at Section 301 tariffs on Chinese exports, to address China\u2019s \u201cstate-centred\u201d trade policies and practices, including what USTR deems to be trade-distorting industrial policies and to focus on working with allies and like-minded countries to address issues of mutual concern relating to China, and to shape the rules for fair trade to facilitate \u201ca race to the top\u201d for market economies. [vii] In addition, two meetings have also been held between the trade representative of the US and China but no breakthrough has been achieved so far. [viii] It may be recalled that on 14 February 2020, the US and China entered into the first phase of the trade agreement, the Economic and Trade Agreement between the US and the People\u2019s Republic of China. [ix] According to the agreement, China agreed to purchase certain US goods and services worth USD 200 billion for two years, starting from 1 January 2020 through 31 December 2021 with 2017 as the baseline year. According to a study by Chad P. Bown of Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), it is evident that China bought none of the items promised Source: Peterson Institute for International Economics [x] However, irrespective of the trade friction, China is the second-largest trading partner of the US after the European Union (EU). The total trade value between China and the US is USD 682.32 billion from January to November in 2021, a year-on-year increase of 30.2 per cent. [xi] China sells almost four times to the US. [xii] The Ambassador of China to the US has said that the \u201cChina-US economic and trade relations are win-win in nature\u201d. He also reiterated that closer economic cooperation between the US-China is not only crucial but also mutually beneficial as the two economies are interdependent. [xiii] . [xiv] As of now, officials from the US have asked for concrete actions from China to purchase US goods and services as under the \u201cPhase One\u201d trade deal. [xv] Overall, the Biden administration has continued protesting China\u2019s economic policies that led to the starting of the trade war. [xvi] President Biden banned 59 firms for their ties with China\u2019s military or surveillance industry, including Huawei Technology and other telecommunication companies. [xvii] On 16 December 2021, the Biden administration imposed trade restrictions on more than 30 Chinese research institutes and entities over human rights violations and alleged development of technologies, for example, brain-control weapons, that affect US national security. [xviii] The trade war has further percolated down to the issue of technology and has become the forefront of the US-China frictions. Under Donald Trump, the US had accused China of cyber theft of intellectual property, coerced IP transfers and unfair trade practices. The US had argued that if China could ban Google and Facebook from entering China, similarly the US can ban Huawei and ZTE . [xix] The Trump administration had tightened restrictions on Huawei by cutting its access to the US components and technology. [xx] This made China aware of the US approach. Xi Jinping has reiterated, \u201cTechnology innovation has become the main battleground in the global strategic game\u201d. Consequently, this has made the US more conscious and they are scrutinising Chinese technical investment more closely. [xxi] The trend has continued under President Biden. In November, the US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo included eight China-based technology entities to the Entity List \u201cto prevent US\u2019 emerging technologies from being used for the PRC\u2019s quantum computing efforts that support military applications\u201d. Subsequently, the US added 37 more entities to its Entity List to \u201cdeter misuse of biotechnology\u201d and other technologies \u201cfor military applications and human rights abuses\u201d. [xxii] Last year President Biden had signed Executive Order 14017 to assess the US vulnerabilities in the critical supply chain. Within six months, the administration came out with a complete comprehensive review of the supply chains for four critical products and established a Supply Chain Disruption Taskforce (SCDTF) to address the challenges arising from the pandemic. An annual report has also been published identifying their vulnerabilities and strategies. [xxiii] In addition, the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength Act of 2022 (the America COMPETES Act of 2022) was passed on 4 February 2022. The Act covers scientific research, economic competitiveness, and funding for the domestic production of semiconductors. It also contained a list of motions on the human rights situation in Xinjiang, a crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong and increasing tensions over Taiwan. [xxiv] The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian has criticised the act. He said the content in the bill regarding China has a \u201cCold-War mentality and zero-sum game mindset\u201d. [xxv] On Taiwan, President Biden\u2019s views were articulated through his two articles written in 2001 and 2020. In 2001, Joe Biden wrote an article in the Washington Post , \u201cNot so deft on Taiwan\u201d [xxvi] ; at this point he was critical of the US support to Taiwan and preferred to maintain strategic ambiguity. Before the US elections, in 2020 he wrote another article for New York-based Chinese-language newspaper World Journal [xxvii] , describing his vision towards the Taiwan issue and supporting the US stance towards Taiwan. In one year of his presidency, despite strong resentment from China, President Biden invited Taiwan to the Summit of Democracy. [xxviii] The Taiwanese Vice President Lai Ching-te met the Vice President of the US briefly during the inauguration of new Honduras President Xiomara Castro. It was the first public meeting between the two Vice-Presidents since they took office. [xxix] Until now the Biden administration has provided arms sales to Taiwan twice. First, on 5 August 2021, the Biden administration agreed to a USD 750 million weapons sale to Taiwan. Second, on 8 February 2022, arm sales worth USD 100 million worth of equipment and services to support its air and missile defence systems to Taiwan. Soon after taking office, President Biden started sending warnings to China against any expansion in East and Southeast Asia. He reiterated that the US position on China\u2019s maritime claims remains the same as the 2016 Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s finding. The US has also rejected aggressive Chinese postures, exploitation of hydrocarbon and fisheries in the South China Sea. [xxx] Periodically, the US has been sending naval and air patrols challenging China's claims of sovereignty over the area and also asserting the freedom of navigation. In the last few years, the US has conducted many Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOP); one in 2015, three in 2016, four in 2017, six in 2018, eight in 2019, and nine in 2020 . [xxxi] President Biden showed no sign of backing down. In the first month in office, he sent two aircraft carrier strike groups for joint operation in the disputed region. [xxxii] Conclusion In the virtual meeting with President Biden, Xi Jinping has reiterated that the most important event in international relations in the coming 50 years will be for China and the US to find the right way to get along. On the other hand, after the virtual summit, President Biden said: \u201cLet\u2019s get something straight, we know each other well. We\u2019re not old friends. It\u2019s pure business.\u201d The contradiction in their perception of bilateral relations is evident. A few developments such as the release of t he CFO of Huawei, Meng Wanzhou from jail have taken place. But largely, the technology issue between the two sides remains complex. At the moment, the trajectory of the trade war appears to be uncertain. This year marks the 50 th anniversary of Richard M. Nixon\u2019s visit to China and the signing of the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9. China is using the occasion to warn the US to refrain from using Taiwan as a \u201cpoker chip\u201d and to remind of its commitments made in the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis Taiwan. Two delegations from the US have visited Taiwan. One delegation led by former US Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and the second led by Mike Pompeo. In the ongoing Ukraine crisis, US-China relations are becoming tenser. China has criticised the US position on the crisis and the chances are that US-China ties will become more antagonistic. President Biden and his administration are attempting a nuanced policy on China. They are making efforts to keep all channels of communication in place and the policies under him are becoming more competitive. To sum up, US-China relations are at a critical juncture and the second year of his presidency will be crucial for bilatera l relations. ***** *Dr. Teshu Singh is a Research Fellow at the Indian Council of World Affairs, New Delhi Disclaimer: Views expressed are personal.

US President Joe Biden delivers remarks on his economic priorities at a Laborers' International Union of North America training center in DeForest, Wisconsin, February 8, 2023. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters CNN \u2014 President Joe Biden said in a new interview that the recently recovered Chinese spy balloon that traversed the continental US did not damage bilateral relations between the two countries. \u201cThe idea shooting down a balloon that\u2019s gathering information over America and that makes relations worse?\u201d Biden told PBS NewsHour\u2019s Judy Woodruff in a wide-ranging interview a day after his second State of the Union address . \u201cI made it real clear to Xi Jinping that we\u2019re going to compete fully with China, but we\u2019re not looking for conflict. That\u2019s been the case so far.\u201d Biden\u2019s response marks the second time this week that he\u2019s sought to downplay the effect of what US officials deemed a \u201cbrazen\u201d act by Beijing to send an intelligence gathering balloon across several US states \u2013 with signs it loitered over key military installations. Sailors assigned to Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group 2 recover debris from a high-altitude surveillance balloon off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, February. 5, 2023. Petty Officer 1st Class Tyler Thompson/US Navy Related article Spy balloon part of a broader Chinese military surveillance operation, US intel sources say Biden, who ordered the US military to shoot down the balloon over open water last week, said he has not spoken to the Chinese leader since the balloon was spotted. But he pointed to continued contacts between officials in his administration and their Chinese counterparts. US officials registered their objections to Chinese officials while the balloon was in flight. They also communicated with Chinese officials after the balloon was shot down, according to senior administration officials. Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed a high-stakes trip to Beijing due to the balloon incursion, undercutting a key element of Biden\u2019s first face-to-face meeting with Xi in November. That meeting was designed to cool tensions that had been rising between the two powers throughout Biden\u2019s opening weeks in office, with Blinken\u2019s follow-up visit to China considered the next marker in the effort. Biden administration officials have stressed that the meeting was not canceled, but instead delayed until a later date. That date has not yet been set. Asked by CNN this week if US officials had any indication as to why China would commit such an overt act, Biden laughed off the question. \u201cThey\u2019re the Chinese government,\u201d he said. Biden administration officials have maintained they were able to move quickly to mitigate any intelligence collection capacity of the balloon and have countered that they will end up benefiting from the ability to collect information about the balloon and Chinese intelligence capabilities, both during its flight and in the recovery of its wreckage from the Atlantic Ocean.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise\u2019s office said the chamber will vote Thursday on a resolution \u201ccondemning the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s use of a high-altitude surveillance balloon over United States territory as a brazen violation of United States sovereignty.\u201d Republicans have criticized Biden for waiting several days before shooting the balloon down, and Sen.

But the president did appear to question China\u2019s strength \u2013 specifically in what has been a fragile economic moment for the country. \u201cHe has an economy that\u2019s not functioning very well,\u201d Biden said. And he detailed a telling observation he shared with Xi last year as US officials warned China not to provide military support to Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. \u201cEverybody assumed that China would be all in with Russia in Ukraine. They\u2019re not all in,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAs a matter of fact I called him this summer to say, this is not a threat, just an observation: Look what\u2019s happened to Russia. Six hundred American corporations have pulled out of Russia, from McDonald\u2019s to Exxon. And I said, \u2018You\u2019ve told me all along that the reason why you need a relationship with the United States and Europe is so they invest in China.\u2019 I said, \u2018Who is gonna invest in China if you engage in the same kind of deal?
