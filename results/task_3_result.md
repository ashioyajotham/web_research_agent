# Task: Download Epoch AI's dataset of large-scale AI models. From this, extract a time series showing how the maximum amount of compute used to train any AI system has changed over time. Each entry in your response must represent a training run which, at the time it happened, set a new record for the maximum amount of compute used to train an AI system.

# Research Results: Download Epoch AI's dataset of large-scale AI models. From this, extract a time series showing how the maximum amount of compute used to train any AI system has changed over time. Each entry in your response must represent a training run which, at the time it happened, set a new record for the maximum amount of compute used to train an AI system.

## Plan

1. **Search for Epoch AI's dataset or publicly available information on large-scale AI model training compute.** (using search)
2. **Analyze search results to identify potential sources of the required data (dataset download link, research papers, blog posts, etc.).** (using browser)
3. **If a dataset is found, download it. If not, repeat step 1 and 2 with modified search queries from the task analysis section, focusing on alternative sources like research papers or publicly accessible benchmarks.** (using browser)
4. **Extract relevant data points: date of training run and compute used (in consistent units).  Handle inconsistencies in data format if necessary.** (using browser)
5. **Identify the training run with the maximum compute used for each time period.  This might involve sorting the data by date and compute, then selecting the rows representing new record highs.** (using browser)
6. **Organize the extracted data into a table with 'Date' and 'Maximum Compute Used' columns.** (using present)
