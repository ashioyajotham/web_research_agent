# Task: Download Epoch AI's dataset of large-scale AI models. From this, extract a time series showing how the maximum amount of compute used to train any AI system has changed over time. Each entry in your response must represent a training run which, at the time it happened, set a new record for the maximum amount of compute used to train an AI system.

# Research Results: Download Epoch AI's dataset of large-scale AI models. From this, extract a time series showing how the maximum amount of compute used to train any AI system has changed over time. Each entry in your response must represent a training run which, at the time it happened, set a new record for the maximum amount of compute used to train an AI system.

## Plan

1. **Search for Epoch AI's dataset on large-scale AI models** (using search)
2. **Identify the location of the Epoch AI dataset from search results** (using browser)
3. **Verify data accessibility and format.  Check if data contains the necessary information (training date, compute used)** (using browser)
4. **Gather information on the methodology used by Epoch AI to determine compute used (e.g., FLOPs)** (using browser)
5. **Extract data points for training runs and their respective compute usage and dates from the dataset** (using browser)
6. **Identify record-breaking training runs by sorting the extracted data by compute usage and selecting only the entries representing new maximums** (using present)
7. **Present the results in a table with 'Date' and 'Maximum Compute Used' columns** (using present)
