# Task: Download Epoch AI's dataset of large-scale AI models. From this, extract a time series showing how the maximum amount of compute used to train any AI system has changed over time. Each entry in your response must represent a training run which, at the time it happened, set a new record for the maximum amount of compute used to train an AI system.

# Research Results: Download Epoch AI's dataset of large-scale AI models. From this, extract a time series showing how the maximum amount of compute used to train any AI system has changed over time. Each entry in your response must represent a training run which, at the time it happened, set a new record for the maximum amount of compute used to train an AI system.

## Plan

1. **Search for Epoch AI's dataset location and access information.** (using search)
2. **Analyze search results to identify the dataset's location and any access requirements (e.g., registration, API key).** (using browser)
3. **If necessary, follow any instructions to access the Epoch AI dataset.** (using browser)
4. **Download the Epoch AI dataset.  (This step assumes successful access and download is possible within the context of this task).** (using browser)
5. **Identify the relevant fields in the dataset containing information on model training dates and compute used (e.g., FLOPs). This might involve manual inspection of the data description or a sample of the data.** (using browser)
6. **Extract data on training dates and compute used from the dataset. Sort the data by compute used in ascending order.** (using browser)
7. **Iterate through the sorted data, creating a new time series showing only the training runs that set a new record for maximum compute used. Each entry represents a new record.** (using browser)
8. **Format the resulting time series into a table with 'Date' and 'Maximum Compute Used' columns.** (using present)

# Large-Scale AI Models

Our Large-Scale AI Models dataset documents over 200 models trained with more
than 1023 floating point operations, at the leading edge of scale and
capabilities.

### The pace of large-scale model releases is accelerating

In 2017, only two models exceeded 1023 FLOP in training compute. By 2020, this
grew to four models; by 2022, there were 32, and by 2024, there were 174
models known to exceed 1023 FLOP in our database, and 99 more with unconfirmed
training compute that likely exceed 1023 FLOP. As AI investment increases and
training hardware becomes more cost-effective, models at this scale come
within reach of more and more developers.
