# Task: Download Epoch AI's dataset of large-scale AI models. From this, extract a time series showing how the maximum amount of compute used to train any AI system has changed over time. Each entry in your response must represent a training run which, at the time it happened, set a new record for the maximum amount of compute used to train an AI system.

# Research Results: Download Epoch AI's dataset of large-scale AI models. From this, extract a time series showing how the maximum amount of compute used to train any AI system has changed over time. Each entry in your response must represent a training run which, at the time it happened, set a new record for the maximum amount of compute used to train an AI system.

## Plan

2. **Analyze search results to identify a reliable download link for the dataset.** (using browser)
3. **If a direct download link is not available, navigate to Epoch AI's website and explore their resources for the dataset.** (using browser)
4. **Download the Epoch AI dataset. This step assumes the dataset is available for download; if not, the plan will need adjustment.** (using browser)
5. **Process the downloaded dataset to identify the date, model name (if available), and compute used for each training run.** (using browser)
6. **Identify record-breaking training runs by sorting the data by compute used in descending order and selecting only the rows representing new maximum compute values.** (using browser)
7. **Create a table summarizing the record-breaking training runs with columns for Date, Model Name (if available), Compute Used (in a consistent unit), and Notes (optional).** (using present)

# Notable AI Models

Our flagship dataset, containing over 900 models that were state of the art,
highly cited, or otherwise historically notable. It tracks key factors driving
machine learning progress and includes over 400 training compute estimates.

### The training compute of notable AI models is doubling roughly every five
months

Since 2010, the training compute used to create AI models has been [growing at
a rate of 4.6x per year](/blog/training-compute-of-frontier-ai-models-grows-
by-4-5x-per-year). Most of this growth comes from [increased
spending](/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-train-frontier-ai-models), although
[improvements in hardware](/blog/trends-in-machine-learning-hardware) have
also played a role.
