# Task: Download Epoch AI's dataset of large-scale AI models. From this, extract a time series showing how the maximum amount of compute used to train any AI system has changed over time. Each entry in your response must represent a training run which, at the time it happened, set a new record for the maximum amount of compute used to train an AI system.

# Research Results: Download Epoch AI's dataset of large-scale AI models. From this, extract a time series showing how the maximum amount of compute used to train any AI system has changed over time. Each entry in your response must represent a training run which, at the time it happened, set a new record for the maximum amount of compute used to train an AI system.

## Plan

1. **Find the location to download Epoch AI's dataset and any associated documentation.** (using search)
2. **Based on the search results, fetch the download page or API documentation for the Epoch AI dataset. Prioritize links directly from Epoch AI's website if available.** (using browser)
3. **Extract the download link or API access instructions from the fetched web page. Also, look for dataset schema information, including field names for model name, training date, and compute used. Look for the definition of compute in the dataset (FLOPs, etc.).** (using browser)
4. **If direct download is available, download the dataset. If API access is required, obtain the necessary API key and authentication details. If neither is clearly available, search more specifically for API information.** (using search)
5. **If API access is needed, use the browser tool to investigate.** (using browser)
6. **Write a Python script to download and parse the Epoch AI dataset. The script should handle potential data formats (CSV, JSON, etc.) and authentication requirements. The script should extract the 'training date' and 'compute' fields for each training run.** (using code)
7. **Execute the Python script to download and parse the dataset. Verify that the 'training_date' and 'compute' fields are correctly extracted.** (using code)
8. **Write a Python script to iterate through the parsed data and identify the training run with the maximum compute at each point in time. Store these record-breaking runs in a list.** (using code)
9. **Execute the Python script to generate the time series of maximum compute values.** (using code)
10. **Format the output into a JSON object containing the time series of maximum compute values, as specified in the TASK ANALYSIS.** (using code)
11. **Execute the final Python script to format and print the JSON output.** (using code)
