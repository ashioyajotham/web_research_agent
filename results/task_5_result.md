# Research Results: Compile a list of companies satisfying the following criteria:

## Plan

1. **Define the specific criteria for company selection.  Replace [criteria 1], [criteria 2], [criteria 3], and [criteria 4] with actual criteria.** (using manual)
2. **Formulate search queries using the defined criteria and the provided search query templates.** (using manual)
3. **Execute the search queries using the 'search' tool.  Start with a smaller number of results (e.g., num_results=10) to test and refine queries.** (using search)
4. **Refine search queries based on initial results. Adjust keywords or phrasing to improve relevance.** (using manual)
5. **Rerun searches with refined queries and increased num_results (e.g., num_results=50).** (using search)
6. **Repeat steps 3-4 with the remaining search queries.  Prioritize queries with the most specific criteria.** (using search)
7. **Consolidate the results from all searches into a single list of company names. Remove duplicates.** (using manual)
8. **Verify that each company on the list meets ALL specified criteria.  This may involve using the 'browser' tool to visit company websites.** (using browser)
9. **Remove companies that do not meet all criteria from the consolidated list.** (using manual)
10. **Present the final list of company names that meet all criteria using the 'present' tool.** (using present)

Issue body actions

The setup area of query manager is very busy even at the empty state and the
interactions for adding and updating key value pair is inconsistent with the
other api management tools like postman and hopscotch

### Why are we doing this

To offer familiar and consistent experience for the user that it will be
easier for the to adapt to and they don’t need to learn a different tool.

### Solutions

Add an empty state when key value pairs are not add  
Make the adding interaction consistent with the commonly used api platform
