In 2023, the value added by non-EU countries in the production of vehicles for export by the EU automotive sector slightly decreased compared to 2022, suggesting a halt in the growing dependence on external providers. In 2023, the value added generated in the Chinese automotive industry due to the EU final use amounted to \u20ac4.0 billion, up from \u20ac1.2 billion in 2010. In 2023, Germany and Poland recorded the largest number of jobs in the EU automotive industry driven by foreign final use, with 274 000 and 109 000 people, respectively. However, these jobs constitute only 0.6% of their overall employment. [[File:Employment and value added using FIGARO data - view into the automotive industry RE 16 07 2025.xlsx]] Domestic and foreign value added embodied in EU automotive exports EU 2010-2023 Source: Eurostat (online data codes: naio_10_fgde, naio_10_fgfeie) This article delves into gross value added and employment in the EU associated with the global value chains (GVCs) in the automotive industry that serves as a classic example of GVCs in Europe. The Draghi Report dedicates a comprehensive chapter to the history, relevance, current status, and challenges faced by the European Union (EU) in this arena. The data analysis focuses on NACE industry C29, encompassing motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers (hereafter referred to as motor vehicles). For simplicity, the terms \u201cvehicles\u201d, \"cars\", and \u201cautomotive,\u201d as well as \u201cindustry\u201d and \u201csector,\u201d are used interchangeably throughout. This article explores the macroeconomic globalisation indicators derived from the FIGARO tables \u2013 full international and global accounts for research in input-output analysis \u2013 and which use the Leontief input-output model ( Miller and Blair, 2022 ). Indeed, GVCs are often not immediately visible in conventional trade statistics, which typically report the total value of a product at the point of trade. What are global value chains The production of goods and services relies on inputs, which can be sourced locally or globally. The final value of a product reflects the value that has been added in the different stages of the production chain, through the combination of factors of production, including employment . Gross value added may be generated, and employment may be located, in multiple countries. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as global value chains (GVCs), which have significantly transformed international trade over the past few decades. GVCs have driven economic growth, innovation, and shaped global production networks, fostering a complex and interconnected world. By fragmenting production across borders, GVCs have capitalised on lower transportation costs and digital infrastructure. However, recent geopolitical events have disrupted the value chains, reshaping the global landscape. In response, countries are adopting policy measures, such as tariffs and export controls, to safeguard their economic security. Under the political guidelines 2024-2029 of the European Commission's President von der Leyen , resilient and strategically managed GVCs will become increasingly crucial for navigating global trade and maintaining economic stability. Value added in trade In 2023, the automotive industry accounted for 1.8% (\u20ac273 billion) of the EU\u2019s total gross value added (\u20ac15 545 billion). Germany was the largest contributor, with a value added of \u20ac160 billion (4.2% of the country's total gross value added), followed by Italy (\u20ac17.5 billion, 0.9%), France (\u20ac15.4 billion, 0.6%), Spain (\u20ac14.3 billion, 1.0%), Czechia (\u20ac12.4 billion, 4.3%), Sweden (\u20ac10.9 billion, 2.2%), and Poland (\u20ac9.3 billion, 1.4%). The automotive industry\u2019s value added is generated to supply domestic consumption and exports. In 2023, EU exports of automotive products to non-EU countries reached \u20ac254.7 billion, representing 6.9% of the EU\u2019s total exports (\u20ac3 688 billion). Meanwhile, EU imports of products of the automotive industry amounted to \u20ac113.2 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of \u20ac124.5 billion. A more detailed analysis of value added in trade reveals that EU exports of automotive products to non-EU countries contained \u20ac196 billion of domestic value added in 2023 (see Figure 1). This indicator, calculated from an EU perspective, represents the gross value added generated in the EU economy by its exports to non-EU economies, and includes value added from different EU countries and industries (spillover effects) within the EU, reflecting the industry\u2019s complex supply chains. In contrast, foreign value added in EU automotive exports to non-EU countries (i.e. gross value added generated outside of the EU by the exports of the EU economy to non-EU economies) generated \u20ac50.1 billion of gross value added outside the EU in 2023. Between 2020 and 2022, the EU\u2019s automotive industry relied increasingly on foreign suppliers for materials, parts, and intermediate goods. This trend, known as vertical specialisation or backward linkage, may be driven by increases in prices, volumes, or both. However, in 2023, the foreign value added in EU exports slightly decreased, indicating a pause in the previously growing trend. Figure 1: Domestic and foreign value added embodied in EU automotive exports, EU, 2010-2023 Source: Eurostat (naio_10_fgde) and (naio_10_fgfeie) Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the involvement of the EU main trading partners in EU vehicles exports over time. Regarding the value added generated in the EU by EU exports (Figure 2), the United Kingdom held the largest share in 2023 (17.6%), closely followed by the United States (17.0%) and China (15.5%). The significance of EU exports to China, in terms of EU domestic value added for the automotive sector, increased substantially from 2010 to 2021 (from 8.6% to 19.3%) but then decreased in 2022 (18.6%) and 2023 (15.5%). Conversely, the share of EU domestic value added in exports to the United Kingdom declined from 22.6% to 16.2% between 2015 and 2021 but then rose in 2022 (16.4%) and 2023 (17.6%). T\u00fcrkiye and Switzerland also represent significant players for the EU domestic value added in automotive sector exports, with shares of 6.7% and 5.0%, respectively, in 2023. The United Kingdom was also the largest player in terms of value added generated outside the EU by EU exports in 2023, accounting for 18.6% of the total value added in non-EU countries from EU automotive exports (Figure 3). Although the share for this country fell from 24.0% in 2015 to 16.5% in 2021, it rebounded to 17.4% in 2022 and 18.6% in 2023, still not reaching its earlier peak. The United States was the second-largest player for the foreign value added in EU automotive exports in 2023, with a share of 16.5%. The share of value added generated in this country recorded the same trend, with a decrease from 17.7% in 2015 to 14.1% in 2021, followed by increases to 16.1% in 2022 and 16.5% in 2023. China, ranking third in 2023 with a share of 14.9%, displayed a different pattern, reaching its highest share of 18.8% in 2021. In this case also, T\u00fcrkiye and Switzerland were significant players, with shares for the foreign value added in EU exports of 7.0% and 4.8%, respectively, in 2023. Analysing the domestic (Figure 2) and foreign (Figure 3) value added in EU automotive exports reveals that the United Kingdom, the United States and China are the key players in the automotive industry, not only as significant importers of EU vehicles but also as a crucial suppliers of inputs required by the EU automotive sector for its exports. Figure 2: Domestic value added embodied in EU automotive exports, EU, by main trading partners, 2010-2023 Figure 3: Foreign value added embodied in EU automotive exports, EU, by main trading partners, 2010-2023 Value added in final use This section explores the value added contribution of the EU automotive industry (domestic value added) to the final use of goods and services in non-EU countries. It also analyses how much value added is generated in the automotive industries of non-EU countries (foreign value added) due to the final use of goods and services of the EU. This approach differs from the one presented in the previous section, which examined the value added contribution of the entire EU economy in the EU exports of the automotive industry to non-EU countries. Figure 4 illustrates the changes in the EU domestic automotive industry value added due to non-EU final use from 2010 to 2023. This indicator shows an upward trend, increasing from \u20ac52.7 billion in 2010 to \u20ac85.3 billion in 2017, before declining to \u20ac63.8 billion in 2020, and then rising again to a peak of \u20ac91.6 billion in 2023. The foreign automotive industry value added from EU final use displays a comparable, though less pronounced, trend. It rose from \u20ac14.9 billion in 2010 to \u20ac30.9 billion in 2019, experienced a brief dip to \u20ac26.0 billion in 2020, and then climbed again to \u20ac34.4 billion in 2023. Figure 4: Domestic and foreign value added in final use, EU, 2010-2023 Source: Eurostat (naio_10_fgdf) A detailed evolution of the domestic value added of the EU automotive industry resulting from non-EU final use, broken by partner country, is provided in the interactive Figure 5. In 2023, the United States represented 20.0% of the total EU automotive industry domestic value added ending up in the final use of non-EU consumers, making that country the largest contributor to the EU value added for the automotive industry. China was the second-largest contributor in 2023; its share increased from 9.1% in 2010 to 19.6% in 2021, before reverting to 16.2% in 2023. The third-largest contributor to the EU automotive value added in 2023 was the United Kingdom, with 14.6% of the EU automotive\u2019s domestic value added generated for the non-EU final use. Together, the United States, China, and the United Kingdom accounted for more than half of the value added generated in the EU automotive industry due to the foreign final use of goods and services in 2023. T\u00fcrkiye and Switzerland, ranking fourth and fifth respectively, are also important market for the EU automotive industry. The foreign value added generated in non-EU automotive industries by EU final use reached \u20ac34.4 billion in 2023. This reflects an increase in nominal terms of 130% since 2010 (\u20ac14.9 billion), and 6% compared with 2022 (\u20ac32.3 billion). Figure 6 illustrates the role of EU final use as a driver of non-EU value added generation, highlighting the contribution from each non-EU country for the period 2010 to 2023. In 2023, Japan accounted for the largest share of value added in the non-EU automotive industry due to EU final use, at 14.2%. The United Kingdom followed with a share of 12.4%. Both countries have experienced significant decreases in their shares in recent years, Japan recording its highest share in 2010 (22.5%) and the United Kingdom in 2014 (21.1%). Chinese automotive producers ranked third in 2023 in terms of EU foreign value added generated by EU final use, with a share of 11.6%, after having peaked at 12.6% in 2022. Collectively, China, Japan, and the United Kingdom accounted for more than one third (38%) of the total EU foreign automotive value added due to EU final use in 2023. Other important countries that generate value added in their automotive industry due to EU final use include T\u00fcrkiye, Mexico, South Korea, and the United States, with shares of 9.9%, 8.5%, 7.3%, and 6.3%, respectively, in 2023. Figure 5: Value added generated in the EU automotive industry by non-EU final use, by main trading partner, 2010-2023 Figure 6: Value added generated in the non-EU automotive industry by EU final use, by main trading partner, 2010-2023 Exposure to trade disruptions The EU automotive industry has strong bilateral relationships with the United States and China. Two angles have been addressed previously: the value added in trade (EU value added in exports), and the value added in final use (EU value added in foreign final use). When appropriately combined, these 2 approaches become an indication of the overall exposure to trade disruptions. This exposure indicator provides a comprehensive view of all linkages between the EU and a target country. For instance, in 2023, the EU exposure towards the United States in the automotive industry reached a peak of \u20ac19.1 billion (see Figure 7). This figure represents the sum of the EU value added in various categories, including: final exports intermediate exports to the United States ending up in its final use, or in a third country\u2019s final use intermediate exports to a third country ending up in the United States. Also, relations with China have been increasing throughout the last decade, from \u20ac5.2 billion in 2010 to \u20ac15.9 billion in 2023. In 2022, the exposure the EU had with China was very close to the one with the United States (17.2% versus 17.5%). EU relationships with both the United States and China in the automotive sector are primarily characterised by greater growth in the EU exposure to these two countries rather than in their exposure to the EU (see Figure 7). From the EU perspective, automotive industry of China has become more exposed to the EU final use of goods and services in recent years, increasing from \u20ac1.3 billion in 2010 to \u20ac4.6 billion in 2023. This growth reflects the rapid integration of the Chinese automotive industry not only into EU final use but also into third-country final use through EU production and into third-country production for EU final use. The exposure of the United States towards the EU also increased over the last decade, though to a lesser extent, rising from \u20ac1.4 billion in 2010 to \u20ac2.5 billion in 2023. Figure 7: Exposure of the EU towards the United States and China, and of the United States and China towards the EU, automotive industry, 2010-2023 Source: Eurostat (naio_10_fgtex) Employment in the automotive sector Examining EU employment triggered by foreign final use provides another lens through which to understand the impact of global value chains on European lives. In 2023, approximately 851 000 workers in the EU automotive industry were employed to meet final demand abroad. Although this represents a decline of 81 000 jobs from the peak in 2015, it remains a significant portion of the automotive industry\u2019s workforce (i.e. 35% of the 2.47 million people working in the EU automotive industry). Among the EU countries, Germany recorded the largest number of workers in the automotive sector employed to satisfy EU foreign final use, with 274 000 workers in 2023. Poland, Czechia, Romania, and Italy followed with 109 000, 66 000, 62 000 and 58 000 workers, respectively. In contrast, Cyprus and Luxembourg have very few workers employed in the automotive sector to meet EU foreign final use. However, these numbers are in line with the size of the countries. Map 1 offers a representation of the EU countries categorised according to the share of people employed in the automotive industry whose job is linked to the foreign final use of goods and services compared to the total employment of the country, expressed as ratio per thousand of people. In 2023, Slovakia (18%) and Czechia (12%) had the highest shares of people employed in the automotive sector whose job was supported by the foreign final use. Hungary (9%), Romania (7%) as well as Germany, Poland and Sweden (all three 6%) also recorded high percentages. In line with the EU average, the shares for Austria and Slovenia each reached 4%. All the other EU countries reported figures below the EU average. Map 1: Employment supported by foreign final use, automotive industry, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (naio_10_fgdfe) Source data for tables and graphs Download Excel file All FIGARO data, for inter-country supply, use, input-out tables and macroeconomic globalisation indicators, including value added and employment, are also available from Circabc . Data sources Concept and definitions Macroeconomic globalisation indicators presented in this article are computed using the FIGARO tables, through the application of the Leontief input-output model. This model relies on the interdependencies between industries and countries, represented mathematically in the form of technical coefficient matrices. The Leontief inverse matrix is derived, which captures the total direct and indirect effects of changes in final use across countries and industries. The FIGARO tables are a statistical product of the integrated global accounts for economic modelling. They are constructed by combining multiple data sources, including National Accounts Main Aggregates (NAMA), Supply and Use Tables (SUTs), Input-Output Tables (IOTs), and trade statistics for goods and services. Meeting standards from the European system of national and regional accounts (ESA 2010) , the methodology ensures alignment with National Accounts concepts, and integrates adjustments for trade asymmetries and valuation differences. The FIGARO tables link national accounts and data on business, trade and employment for tor the 27 EU Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, and Sweden), 5 EU candidate countries (Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and T\u00fcrkiye), and 17 main EU trading partners (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Norway, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). A 'rest of the world' region completes the FIGARO tables. The FIGARO tables present the relationship between economies at a detailed level of 64 industries and 64 products, following the NACE and CPA classifications, as defined in the ESA 2010 national accounts transmission programme . Key steps in the FIGARO process involve harmonising classifications, estimating trade margins, and balancing bilateral trade flows between countries, aligned with National Accounts. This process generates inter-country supply, use and input-output tables that detail the flows of goods and services across industries and countries, enabling comprehensive analysis of global value chains, production, and environmental impacts. The following main applications are produced based on the FIGARO tables: macroeconomic globalisation indicators, greenhouse gas footprints linked to final consumption and investment in the EU. Indicators The following macroeconomic globalisation indicators are calculated: Imports by industry = the total imports (intra- and extra-EU) of goods and services for the intermediate and final uses of the EU. The values are measured in basic prices and differ from the international trade statistics, which are measured in CIF values and do not follow the national accounts concepts. They measured in million euros. Exports by industry = the total exports (intra- and extra-EU) of goods and services for intermediate and final uses. The values are measured in basic prices and differ from the international trade statistics, which are measured in FOB values and do not follow the national accounts concepts. They are measured in million euros. Domestic value added in exports - EU perspective = the gross value added generated in the EU by its exports to non-EU economies. It reflects the value added generated in the EU economy, by the direct and indirect production of products for export. It is measured in thousand euros and as percentage of EU exports. Domestic value added in exports - country perspective = the gross value added generated in a EU country by its exports to other countries (EU and non-EU ones). It reflects the value added generated in the EU country, by the direct and indirect production of products for export. It is measured in thousand euros and as percentage of the EU country's exports. Foreign value added in exports - EU perspective = the gross value added generated outside the EU by its exports to non-EU economies. It refers to the value added generated in non-EU economies by the imports of goods and services used by the EU economy to produce other goods and services for export. It is measured in thousand euros and as percentage of EU exports. Foreign value added in exports - country perspective = the gross value added generated outside the EU country by its exports to other countries (EU and non-EU ones). It refers to the value added generated in the other countries by the imports of goods and services used by the EU country to produce other goods and services for export. It is measured in thousand euros and as percentage of EU country\u2019s exports. Domestic value added in foreign final use = the gross value added generated in a EU economy (in the EU as a whole or in a specific EU country) by the final use abroad (outside the EU or -outside the specific EU country, respectively). It captures the value added created in the EU as a whole or in the specific EU country along the value chain of goods and services that are used by final consumers abroad. It is measured in thousand euros. Foreign value added in domestic final use = the gross value added generated abroad by the domestic final use of the EU as a whole or of a specific EU country. It reflects the foreign value added incorporated into the domestic final use of products of the EU economy, highlighting how industries abroad are connected to the final consumers in the EU as a whole or in the specific EU country. It is measured in thousand euros. Global value chain participation - EU perspective = the sum of backward and forward participation from the EU perspective. The backward participation is calculated as a share of foreign (non-EU) value added in EU exports. The forward participation is calculated as the domestic value added generated in the EU by non-EU economies\u2019 exports. It is also measured as a share of EU exports. Global value chain participation - country perspective = the sum of backward and forward participation from the country perspective. The backward participation is calculated as a share of foreign (EU and non-EU) value added in a EU country's exports. The forward participation is calculated as the domestic value added generated in a EU country by other countries' exports. It is also measured as a share of the EU country's total exports. Trading partner exposure = the domestic gross value added generated by the exports of an economy to a trade partner directly and indirectly through third countries. This indicator is built up on domestic value added in exports and domestic value added in foreign final use, and enables a more comprehensive assessment of the dependencies and potential vulnerabilities between the EU and its trade partners. It is measured in thousand euros. Domestic employment in exports - EU perspective = the employment in the EU supported by its exports (extra-EU). It reflects the employment supported in the EU by the production in the EU economy of products for export. It is measured in number of persons and as a percentage of the total EU employment. Domestic employment in exports - country perspective = the employment in an EU country supported by its exports (intra and extra-EU). It reflects the employment supported in the country by the production in its own economy of products for export. It is measured in number of persons and as a percentage of the total EU country\u2019s employment. Domestic employment in foreign final use = the employment in a EU economy (in the EU as a whole or in a specific EU country) supported by the final use abroad (outside the EU or outside the specific EU country, respectively). It captures the employment supported in the EU as a whole or in the specific EU country along the value chain of goods and services that are used by final consumers abroad. It is measured in number of persons and as a percentage of the total employment in the EU or in the EU country. More information on the indicators, their definition and use can be found in the Statistical Working Paper Macroeconomic globalisation indicators based on FIGARO. Insights into the measurement of value added and employment in the EU . It is worth mentioning that the macroeconomic globalisation indicators provide results in values (not differentiating between prices and volumes). Hence, results and conclusions about dependence in global value chains must be carefully considered. Frequency and availability The FIGARO tables and applications, including the macroeconomic globalisation indicators, are produced and updated annually. In 2025, the time series from 2010 to 2023 has been published (period T +24 months, T being the year of release). The time series is in line with the latest macroeconomic aggregates. More information For more information, please refer to the thematic section for the supply, use, input-output and FIGARO tables . Context Partners The FIGARO tables are the result of a long-term collaboration between Eurostat and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre . Both partners also collaborate within the GIANT initiative (Global Input-Output Accounts), which is an global inter-agency network comprising the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UN-ECLAC), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UN-ECA), and the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which aims to explore synergies and common action among the various initiatives on the compilation of multi-country (extended) supply, use, and input-output tables. Purpose The FIGARO tables provide the first official inter-country supply, use and input-output data for the EU. They are a tool for analysing the social, economic and environmental effects of globalisation. These may be analysed through studies on competitiveness, growth, productivity, employment, environmental footprint and international trade (for example, analyses of global value chains). The tables are used to evaluate EU policies and assess the economic interdependencies of the EU (or the euro area or individual EU countries) in a globalised world.

For more than 150 years, it has been a key driver of prosperity in the region. The European automotive and supplier industry is facing unprecedented pressure from both external and internal challenges. There is a distortion of competition, especially from heavily subsidised Chinese manufacturers, alongside difficult location factors like high-energy costs and extensive regulatory requirements such as excessive reporting obligations. Additionally, the demand for cars in general - and electric vehicles in particular - has decreased rapidly. At the same time, the industry is adjusting to the EU climate and environmental targets - the highest worldwide - whilst managing the pressing need to transition towards digital technologies. The EPP Group supports the proposal of the President of the Commission to open a Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the Automotive Sector, a process that will personally be led by the President herself, and in which participation will be required from automotive stakeholders, representatives from the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of the EU. The EPP Group demands that, as a result of this dialogue, a holistic EU strategy will be defined that helps the sector manage the various challenges and reviews the applicable EU regulatory framework. The EPP Group also sees the following immediate and long-term measures as key for preserving a globally competitive key industry that provides high-quality jobs and prosperity within Europe, all whilst achieving climate neutrality by 2050. 1. Ensuring that the Best Technologies Can Compete The EU must re-establish technological neutrality as a core guiding principle, taking into account the realities of the sector. Recent policy decisions - such as the revised CO2 emissions performance standards for cars and vans (2019/631) and heavy-duty vehicles (2019/1242) - have compromised this principle by effectively banning the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles. As technological neutrality embodies the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the ban is irreconcilable with EU law. Additionally, the current regulation focuses only on tailpipe emissions, overlooking the broader environmental impact of vehicle production, use, and disposal. This approach disproportionately favours electric vehicles and limits fair competition among different technologies. It is, therefore, essential to establish a level playing field that enables the best technologies to compete. All technologies that can contribute to achieving climate goals should be treated fairly, without favouring or biasing any particular technological solution. The EU's climate policy should prioritise market-based measures over blanket bans. This approach allows CO\u2082 reductions to be achieved at the lowest cost, while giving consumers choice and enabling engineers to compete in developing the best solutions. Consumers deserve access to the lowest-cost technologies and the best possible information to choose the mobility solution that fits their needs. Correcting the ICE Ban : The upcoming 2035 ban on internal combustion engines (ICEs) should be reversed in order to reflect technological neutrality, meaning to allow a mix of technologies while staying on track to achieve the Union's decarbonisation targets. Whilst electric vehicles (EVs) will play a major role in the transition towards a climate neutral future, other technologies can also help to achieve our climate targets. The European Commission must urgently present a revision to Regulation 2019/631 that reintroduces the technological neutral approach and acknowledges the role of all technologies in achieving CO2 reductions. The revision should recognise the role of alternative fuels, including e-fuels, biofuels, renewable or synthetic fuels, by providing explicit exemptions, accompanied by other measures such as introducing a carbon-correction factor, thus revising the ICE ban from 2035 onwards. Within this revision, the Commission should also propose a definition for carbon-neutral fuels, ensuring an appropriate reduction in emissions compared to conventional fuels, ultimately reaching climate neutrality by 2050. It should also acknowledge the role of other technologies, such as plug-in hybrids (PHEV), and ensure adequate enabling conditions across the EU, such as the availability and affordability of EVs, recharging and refuelling infrastructure and alternative fuels. Review: Given the long development processes in the automotive industry, the EU Commission must move the scheduled review for Regulation (EU) 2019/631 forward to 2025 in order to correct the ICE ban and provide the sector with legal certainty and planning security as soon as possible. While a combination of policies is needed, it is important to note that the positive climate impact of the ETS by 2030 is estimated to be 25-times-higher than those of Regulation 2019/631. This limited climate impact must be taken into account while weighing the targets against imminent job losses and deindustrialisation in Europe. Heavy-duty Vehicles and Trailer Targets: European emission reduction targets must be ambitious yet realistic for the industry to achieve. The recent revision of the Regulation on CO2 emissions performance standards for heavy-duty vehicles (Regulation (EU) 2019/1242) failed to achieve this balance. By the end of 2026, the Commission should review Regulation 2019/1242 and adjust the heavy-duty vehicles and trailer targets to ease burdens on mid-cap companies and adopt a technology-neutral approach by recognising the role of alternative fuels. Avoid Penalties: The sales market for electric cars is not developing as expected. Sales figures are lagging behind expectations, and manufacturers are at risk of failing to reach their 2025 emission reduction target, resulting in potential fines in the billions. In the current crisis, manufacturers need their revenues to master the transformation. The Commission should carry out an analysis of the current situation and the expected development in the 2025 review and then decide which measures are needed to maintain the competitiveness of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). These temporary relief measures could include options such as allowing banking and accounting of parts of sales, assessing compliance based on a three-year average, or temporarily adjusting the calculation method for penalties to take into account cars produced and not only cars registered. All these measures should take into account the efforts and investments that companies have already taken and thus avoid legal challenges. If penalties are unavoidable, they need to be reinvested in the European automotive sector for specific purposes (e.g. for infrastructure deployment, incentive schemes, digitalisation) instead of the general EU budget. It is necessary to prioritise pooling alliances within the EU or with like-minded partners to ensure that OEMs can enhance their competitiveness without giving advantages to external players. Synergy Effects With Other Sectors and Market-based Measures: Achieving climate goals requires decarbonising not only new vehicles but also the existing fleet. By allowing a variety of technologies beyond 2035, we can increase the use of alternative fuels, which are also compatible with current vehicles while allowing space for future innovation. Sectors that depend entirely on alternative fuels for decarbonisation would also benefit from this expanded market. In the context of Union-wide climate targets for 2040, it is also vital to acknowledge the production and use of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels including, from non-biological and biological origins and recycled carbon fuels from non-sustainable industrial processes as carbon-neutral beyond 2040. This recognition would promote synergies between transportation and industrial decarbonisation, balancing the supply and demand of e-fuels, biofuels and carbon-neutral synthetic fuels, while also helping both sectors lower their carbon footprints. Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) : It is of utmost importance that the EU finally develops a comprehensive LCA methodology by December 2025 to evaluate the environmental impact of vehicles from production to disposal and introduce it into the EU legislation. The Commission, having had the task of coming up with an LCA methodology since 2019, should introduce the LCA in Regulation 2019/631 and in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 as soon as possible, finally respecting the will of the EU legislator. 2. Accelerating Infrastructure Roll-Out The suitability for everyday use and social acceptance of EVs depends largely on price affordability, the development of the electricity grid, the provision and functionality of the charging infrastructure, as well as the installation of charging points in buildings. The lack of adequate charging and refuelling infrastructure is a significant obstacle to the widespread adoption of EVs and other sustainable technologies. Whilst the installation of infrastructure for light-duty vehicles is lagging behind, the infrastructure for heavy-duty vehicles is practically non-existent. The EU and its Member States must act decisively to build the required infrastructure. We need a comprehensive infrastructure offensive that safeguards an equitable distribution between Member States and regions. Infrastructure Investment: Simplified permitting processes and financial incentives should drive the roll-out of publicly accessible charging stations and refuelling points as well as the installation of charging points in buildings. The lengthy grid connection and permitting processes in Europe significantly delay the roll-out of charging infrastructure. The European Commission and Member States should do their utmost to improve permitting procedures, scale up electricity production, increase grid capacity, provide additional funding sources, and consider introducing mandatory deadlines for approvals, as seen in the Critical Raw Materials Acts (CRMA) and the Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA). Infrastructure Deployment: The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) has set concrete targets for the deployment of refuelling and recharging infrastructure. Member States must ensure a coherent and consistent implementation to unlock the full potential of the Single Market. However, it is also clear that more ambition is needed. Member States and the Commission should work together to ensure that additional infrastructure is deployed, e.g. through public-private partnerships, especially in less developed regions. The review of AFIR should go hand in hand with the review of Regulation 2019/631 and lead to more ambitious targets, in particular for heavy-duty-vehicles infrastructure. The Member States should also improve shared charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in buildings. 3. Supply Chain Resilience and Rules-Based International Trade The automotive industry operates in a highly competitive international environment. Europe needs to ensure a level playing field between domestic and foreign producers. Where unfair practices such as dumping or unfair subsidies occur, the EU must take countervailing measures. At the same time, the EU automotive industry is highly dependent on critical raw materials (CRM) for battery production, which are largely sourced from a small number of countries. The EU must diversify and secure its supply chains to ensure sustainable production in the long term. Trade Agreements and International Cooperation : In order to diversify the supply chains, reduce dependencies and open new markets for the EU economy, the EU should finalise ongoing negotiations on trade agreements, initiate new negotiations and other forms of international cooperation with countries or regions such as ASEAN, and strengthen existing relationships with other third countries. Circular Economy Requirements: Efficient circular economy business models can play a significant role to help reduce reliance on imported raw materials, contributing to the sustainability of EV battery production within Europe. Regulation 2023/0284 on circularity requirements for vehicle design and on the management of end-of-life vehicles needs to strengthen circular business models by setting up a framework that facilitates and supports the EU automotive sector to develop itself as a leader in sustainable automotive innovation and strengthen the sector's competitiveness while reducing strategic dependencies. Raw Materials: A clear strategy for implementing the Critical Raw Materials Act as well as an ambitious action plan for CRMs that goes beyond those laid out in the CRMA is indispensable to support the CRM value chain, including the establishment of new production capacities and ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector. Within the EU, there are significant opportunities for extracting Critical Raw Materials essential for battery production and electrification. Additionally, the European Commission should collaborate with the automotive and mining industry to explore potential joint ventures for sourcing, extracting, and processing these materials, ensuring a predictable and sustainable supply chain for critical raw materials. As part of its Strategic Partnership agenda, the EU should financially support European companies' key projects in third countries to enable European companies to secure and diversify their supply of critical minerals, and ensure that critical minerals from Strategic Partner countries are directed to Europe. The EU should also foster the exchange of best practices, such as JOGMEC in Japan. Countering Unfair Practices: The European Commission has appropriately imposed anti-subsidy duties on the imports of battery electric vehicles originating from China. However, negotiations should continue to find a solution to the dispute as anti-subsidy duties are a measure of last resort. The Commission should also closely monitor any circumvention attempts and make full use of the instruments under the foreign direct subsidy regulation. In the event such practices are identified, it will swiftly activate the available trade defence instruments, including anti-subsidy and anti-dumping measures, while ensuring the continuation of diplomatic dialogue to resolve disputes. Reciprocity: The EU should address global structural trade imbalances with China and other economies by applying multilateral trade rules, enhancing EU trade tools, pro-actively supporting the reform of the WTO and firmly upholding the principle of reciprocity. 4. Promoting Innovation and Research & Development Europe must strengthen its global leadership in automotive innovation by investing in forward-looking technologies like autonomous driving, Artificial Intelligence and alternative fuels. Enhancing R&D capabilities will position the EU to compete effectively in the global market. Additionally, increased funding is essential to support the transformation of the automotive sector and the regions impacted. Increased R&D Funding : The EU should raise direct funding for automotive R&D, prioritising AI, autonomous driving and alternative fuels. Partnerships between the public and private sectors should be promoted in order to accelerate innovation and facilitate deployment. The EU should take appropriate measures to prevent illegal technology transfers and protect the intellectual property rights of European companies. Aid for Regions Affected : The EU's Industrial Action Plan for the automotive sector should propose financial support measures (e.g. the Extension of the Just Transition Fund beyond 2027) to aid regions affected by the sector's transformation. Furthermore, targeted financial support schemes should not focus exclusively on the construction of new production facilities, but also on the transformation of existing facilities . Therefore, the European Commission should conduct a review of state aid guidelines to allow targeted funding schemes that address the industrial transition needs of companies, including suppliers, more effectively while maintaining fair competition among Member States. Reskilling & Upskilling: To strengthen the skills and capabilities of the current and future workforce, effective upskilling and reskilling programs must be implemented, addressing labour market demands, workforce shortages, and an ageing population. The closure of factories, relocation to third countries and job losses in Europe underscore the risks facing the automotive sector when competitiveness is overlooked. Foster EU Production: Carbon leakage in the automotive sector poses a significant threat. Importing electric vehicles from external markets like China, where emissions standards may differ, risks transferring emissions rather than achieving real global reductions. To genuinely ensure emission reductions, it is essential that EVs and key components are produced within Europe, preserving jobs, economic value, innovation and high environmental standards. Financial aid should prioritise vehicles manufactured in the EU, reinforcing local production and ensuring resilience against external dependencies. Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) : IPCEIs are crucial in attracting investment to critical digital and green automotive technologies in Europe. However, reforming the IPCEI framework is necessary to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and predictability of the application process without disrupting the EU internal market. Data Access : The European Commission should introduce sector-specific regulations on access to in-vehicle data, supplementing the Data Act. This regulation should facilitate better access to in-vehicle data while ensuring the highest standard of cybersecurity and data protection. The Commission should also review and streamline the existing legislative framework to minimise administrative burdens by reducing overlaps. The European Commission should also actively promote the expansion of secure cross-border data transfers. Better access to globally connected and secure data is crucial, especially for advancing research and development in autonomous driving and vehicle safety. Steer Demand : To boost the sales of sustainable vehicles, Member States should introduce innovative support schemes such as purchase incentives, VAT reductions, or subsidised leasing. To aid this, the EU Commission should foster the exchange of best practices and publish guidelines to ensure that European producers truly benefit. To support potential national projects, the EU should consider advancing revenues from ETS 2 (Social Climate Fund and national income) with the help of the European Investment Bank. Additionally, the Commission should ensure that national ETS-2 revenues are used effectively and support households in transitioning to clean mobility. 5. Simplifying the Regulatory Framework The complexity of the current regulatory framework and the excessive reporting obligations are some of the biggest barriers to innovation and growth within Europe. Concrete action is needed. Stress Test of the EU Acquis : The EU should conduct a comprehensive review of all existing legislation, including secondary legislation, affecting the automotive sector. A simplified, harmonised and streamlined regulatory environment and reporting obligations will reduce compliance costs and make it easier for companies to focus on innovation. The application of the \"One-in-Two-out\"-rule should be a guiding principle for future legislation. The Commission should also examine how digital one-stop solutions can simplify and facilitate compliance with reporting obligations and how they can be implemented. Simplification of Secondary Legislation: To create a more streamlined and transparent regulatory environment, the EU should introduce a simplification process for secondary legislation. This could include actions such as grouping related regulatory requirements into batches and systematically phasing out outdated regulations within a 5-year timeframe. Mandatory Competitiveness Checks : Any new legislative and policy proposal, including secondary legislation, must undergo an extensive Competitiveness Check before its publication, examining its potential impacts on the competitiveness of Europe and European companies globally. The Commission should commit to present legislative and policy proposals only if they have no negative effect on competitiveness and have explicitly received a positive opinion from the Regulatory Scrutiny Board. Conclusion The EPP Group supports a comprehensive strategy to address these major challenges through flexible, technology-neutral policies that encourage innovation, support infrastructure development, protect jobs, maintain both Europe's global competitiveness and deliver on our climate ambitions. Europe must remain a strong, competitive location for the automotive and supplier industry, enabling it to lead in this new era of transformation while fulfilling its role in reaching ambitious climate goals. The EPP Group stands ready to support the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the Automotive Sector and expects from the new Commission a commitment to revise Regulation 2019/631 as soon as possible in 2025. This revision should revise the ICE ban, help avoid penalties, develop enabling conditions, and increase the efforts for infrastructure deployment in order to make the European automotive industry competitive whilst achieving the decarbonisation of the transport sector, thus contributing to the EU's climate neutrality target for 2050.
