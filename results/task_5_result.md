is AI? AI Ethics AI Inventory What is Artificial Intelligence? Defining Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc. There is no single, simple definition of artificial intelligence because AI tools are capable of a wide range of tasks and outputs, but NASA follows the definition of AI found within EO 13960 , which references Section 238(g) of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2019. Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight, or that can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data sets. An artificial system developed in computer software, physical hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring human-like perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or physical action. An artificial system designed to think or act like a human, including cognitive architectures and neural networks. A set of techniques, including machine learning that is designed to approximate a cognitive task. An artificial system designed to act rationally, including an intelligent software agent or embodied robot that achieves goals using perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communicating, decision-making, and acting. How Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Fit Together Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML): AI tools used at NASA sometimes use machine learning, which uses data and algorithms to train computers to make classifications, generate predictions, or uncover similarities or trends across large datasets. Some common methods used at NASA include: Decision Support Complex processes require tools to consider imperfect or unknown situations. This method of artificial intelligence considers multiple outcomes and probabilities to inform decisions. Deep learning A subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with many layers. It distinguishes itself from other forms of neural networks primarily through its capability to learn features automatically from data. Natural language processing A subset of machine learning that trains computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. Neural networks A method to train computers to process data in a way that\u2019s inspired by the human brain, using a layered, interconnected neuron-inspired structure.

What is artificial intelligence (AI)? 9 August 2024 Link copied Authors Cole Stryker Staff Editor, AI Models IBM Think Eda Kavlakoglu Program Manager What is AI? Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy. Applications and devices equipped with AI can see and identify objects. They can understand and respond to human language. They can learn from new information and experience. They can make detailed recommendations to users and experts. They can act independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention (a classic example being a self-driving car). But in 2024, most AI researchers, practitioners and most AI-related headlines are focused on breakthroughs in generative AI (gen AI), a technology that can create original text, images, video and other content. To fully understand generative AI, it\u2019s important to first understand the technologies on which generative AI tools are built: machine learning (ML) and deep learning .

Machine learning A simple way to think about AI is as a series of nested or derivative concepts that have emerged over more than 70 years: Directly underneath AI, we have machine learning, which involves creating models by training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data. It encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable computers to learn from and make inferences based on data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. There are many types of machine learning techniques or algorithms, including linear regression , logistic regression , decision trees , random forest , support vector machines (SVMs) , k-nearest neighbor (KNN), clustering and more. Each of these approaches is suited to different kinds of problems and data. But one of the most popular types of machine learning algorithm is called a neural network (or artificial neural network). Neural networks are modeled after the human brain's structure and function. A neural network consists of interconnected layers of nodes (analogous to neurons) that work together to process and analyze complex data. Neural networks are well suited to tasks that involve identifying complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data. The simplest form of machine learning is called supervised learning , which involves the use of labeled data sets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. In supervised learning, humans pair each training example with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs in the training data, so it can predict the labels of new, unseen data. Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, that more closely simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain. Deep neural networks include an input layer, at least three but usually hundreds of hidden layers, and an output layer, unlike neural networks used in classic machine learning models, which usually have only one or two hidden layers. These multiple layers enable unsupervised learning : they can automate the extraction of features from large, unlabeled and unstructured data sets, and make their own predictions about what the data represents. Because deep learning doesn\u2019t require human intervention, it enables machine learning at a tremendous scale. It is well suited to natural language processing (NLP) , computer vision , and other tasks that involve the fast, accurate identification complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data. Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in our lives today. Deep learning also enables: Semi-supervised learning , which combines supervised and unsupervised learning by using both labeled and unlabeled data to train AI models for classification and regression tasks. Self-supervised learning , which generates implicit labels from unstructured data, rather than relying on labeled data sets for supervisory signals. Reinforcement learning , which learns by trial-and-error and reward functions rather than by extracting information from hidden patterns. Transfer learning , in which knowledge gained through one task or data set is used to improve model performance on another related task or different data set. Generative AI Generative AI, sometimes called \"gen AI\" , refers to deep learning models that can create complex original content such as long-form text, high-quality images, realistic video or audio and more in response to a user\u2019s prompt or request. At a high level, generative models encode a simplified representation of their training data, and then draw from that representation to create new work that\u2019s similar, but not identical, to the original data. Generative models have been used for years in statistics to analyze numerical data. But over the last decade, they evolved to analyze and generate more complex data types. This evolution coincided with the emergence of three sophisticated deep learning model types: Variational autoencoders or VAEs, which were introduced in 2013, and enabled models that could generate multiple variations of content in response to a prompt or instruction. Diffusion models, first seen in 2014, which add \"noise\" to images until they are unrecognizable, and then remove the noise to generate original images in response to prompts. Transformers (also called transformer models), which are trained on sequenced data to generate extended sequences of content (such as words in sentences, shapes in an image, frames of a video or commands in software code). Transformers are at the core of most of today\u2019s headline-making generative AI tools, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, Copilot, BERT, Bard and Midjourney.

Watch the series How generative AI works In general, generative AI operates in three phases: Training, to create a foundation model. Tuning, to adapt the model to a specific application. Generation, evaluation and more tuning, to improve accuracy. Training Generative AI begins with a \"foundation model\"; a deep learning model that serves as the basis for multiple different types of generative AI applications. The most common foundation models today are large language models (LLMs) , created for text generation applications. But there are also foundation models for image, video, sound or music generation, and multimodal foundation models that support several kinds of content. To create a foundation model, practitioners train a deep learning algorithm on huge volumes of relevant raw, unstructured, unlabeled data, such as terabytes or petabytes of data text or images or video from the internet. The training yields a neural network of billions of parameters encoded representations of the entities, patterns and relationships in the data that can generate content autonomously in response to prompts. This is the foundation model. This training process is compute-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. It requires thousands of clustered graphics processing units (GPUs) and weeks of processing, all of which typically costs millions of dollars. Open source foundation model projects, such as Meta's Llama-2, enable gen AI developers to avoid this step and its costs. Tuning Next, the model must be tuned to a specific content generation task. This can be done in various ways, including: Fine-tuning, which involves feeding the model application-specific labeled data, questions or prompts the application is likely to receive, and corresponding correct answers in the wanted format. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), in which human users evaluate the accuracy or relevance of model outputs so that the model can improve itself. This can be as simple as having people type or talk back corrections to a chatbot or virtual assistant. Generation, evaluation and more tuning Developers and users regularly assess the outputs of their generative AI apps, and further tune the model even as often as once a week for greater accuracy or relevance. In contrast, the foundation model itself is updated much less frequently, perhaps every year or 18 months. Another option for improving a gen AI app's performance is retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a technique for extending the foundation model to use relevant sources outside of the training data to refine the parameters for greater accuracy or relevance. AI agents and agentic AI An AI agent is an autonomous AI program, it can perform tasks and accomplish goals on behalf of a user or another system without human intervention, by designing its own workflow and using available tools (other applications or services). Agentic AI is a system of multiple AI agents, the efforts of which are coordinated, or orchestrated, to accomplish a more complex task or a greater goal than any single agent in the system could accomplish. Unlike chatbots and other AI models which operate within predefined constraints and require human intervention, AI agents and agentic AI exhibit autonomy, goal-driven behavior and adaptability to changing circumstances. The terms \u201cagent\u201d and \u201cagentic\u201d refer to these models\u2019 agency , or their capacity to act independently and purposefully. One way to think of agents is as a natural next step after generative AI. Gen AI models focus on creating content based on learned patterns; agents use that content to interact with each other and other tools to make decisions, solve problems and complete tasks. For example, a gen AI app might be able to tell you the best time to climb Mt. Everest given your work schedule, but an agent can tell you this, and then use an online travel service to book you the best flight and reserve a room in the most convenient hotel in Nepal. Explore our 2025 guide to AI agents Benefits of AI AI offers numerous benefits across various industries and applications. Some of the most commonly cited benefits include: Automation of repetitive tasks. More and faster insight from data. Enhanced decision-making. Fewer human errors. 24x7 availability. Reduced physical risks. Automation of repetitive tasks AI can automate routine, repetitive and often tedious tasks including digital tasks such as data collection, entering and preprocessing, and physical tasks such as warehouse stock-picking and manufacturing processes. This automation frees to work on higher value, more creative work. Enhanced decision-making Whether used for decision support or for fully automated decision-making, AI enables faster, more accurate predictions and reliable, data-driven decisions . Combined with automation, AI enables businesses to act on opportunities and respond to crises as they emerge, in real time and without human intervention. Fewer human errors AI can reduce human errors in various ways, from guiding people through the proper steps of a process, to flagging potential errors before they occur, and fully automating processes without human intervention. This is especially important in industries such as healthcare where, for example, AI-guided surgical robotics enable consistent precision. Machine learning algorithms can continually improve their accuracy and further reduce errors as they're exposed to more data and \"learn\" from experience. Round-the-clock availability and consistency AI is always on, available around the clock, and delivers consistent performance every time. Tools such as AI chatbots or virtual assistants can lighten staffing demands for customer service or support. In other applications such as materials processing or production lines, AI can help maintain consistent work quality and output levels when used to complete repetitive or tedious tasks. Reduced physical risk By automating dangerous work such as animal control, handling explosives, performing tasks in deep ocean water, high altitudes or in outer space, AI can eliminate the need to put human workers at risk of injury or worse. While they have yet to be perfected, self-driving cars and other vehicles offer the potential to reduce the risk of injury to passengers. AI use cases The real-world applications of AI are many. Here is just a small sampling of use cases across various industries to illustrate its potential: Customer experience, service and support Companies can implement AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to handle customer inquiries, support tickets and more. These tools use natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI capabilities to understand and respond to customer questions about order status, product details and return policies. Chatbots and virtual assistants enable always-on support, provide faster answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), free human agents to focus on higher-level tasks, and give customers faster, more consistent service. Fraud detection Machine learning and deep learning algorithms can analyze transaction patterns and flag anomalies, such as unusual spending or login locations, that indicate fraudulent transactions. This enables organizations to respond more quickly to potential fraud and limit its impact, giving themselves and customers greater peace of mind. Personalized marketing Retailers, banks and other customer-facing companies can use AI to create personalized customer experiences and marketing campaigns that delight customers, improve sales and prevent churn. Based on data from customer purchase history and behaviors, deep learning algorithms can recommend products and services customers are likely to want, and even generate personalized copy and special offers for individual customers in real time. Human resources and recruitment AI-driven recruitment platforms can streamline hiring by screening resumes, matching candidates with job descriptions, and even conducting preliminary interviews using video analysis. These and other tools can dramatically reduce the mountain of administrative paperwork associated with fielding a large volume of candidates. It can also reduce response times and time-to-hire, improving the experience for candidates whether they get the job or not. Application development and modernization Generative AI code generation tools and automation tools can streamline repetitive coding tasks associated with application development, and accelerate the migration and modernization (reformatting and replatorming) of legacy applications at scale. These tools can speed up tasks, help ensure code consistency and reduce errors. Predictive maintenance Machine learning models can analyze data from sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and operational technology (OT) to forecast when maintenance will be required and predict equipment failures before they occur. AI-powered preventive maintenance helps prevent downtime and enables you to stay ahead of supply chain issues before they affect the bottom line. AI challenges and risks Organizations are scrambling to take advantage of the latest AI technologies and capitalize on AI's many benefits. This rapid adoption is necessary, but adopting and maintaining AI workflows comes with challenges and risks. Data risks AI systems rely on data sets that might be vulnerable to data poisoning, data tampering, data bias or cyberattacks that can lead to data breaches. Organizations can mitigate these risks by protecting data integrity and implementing security and availability throughout the entire AI lifecycle, from development to training and deployment and postdeployment. Model risks Threat actors can target AI models for theft, reverse engineering or unauthorized manipulation. Attackers might compromise a model\u2019s integrity by tampering with its architecture, weights or parameters; the core components that determine a model\u2019s behavior, accuracy and performance. Operational risks Like all technologies, models are susceptible to operational risks such as model drift, bias and breakdowns in the governance structure. Left unaddressed, these risks can lead to system failures and cybersecurity vulnerabilities that threat actors can use. Ethics and legal risks If organizations don\u2019t prioritize safety and ethics when developing and deploying AI systems, they risk committing privacy violations and producing biased outcomes. For example, biased training data used for hiring decisions might reinforce gender or racial stereotypes and create AI models that favor certain demographic groups over others. AI ethics and governance AI ethics is a multidisciplinary field that studies how to optimize AI's beneficial impact while reducing risks and adverse outcomes. Principles of AI ethics are applied through a system of AI governance consisted of guardrails that help ensure that AI tools and systems remain safe and ethical. AI governance encompasses oversight mechanisms that address risks. An ethical approach to AI governance requires the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, including developers, users, policymakers and ethicists, helping to ensure that AI-related systems are developed and used to align with society's values. Here are common values associated with AI ethics and responsible AI : Explainability and interpretability As AI becomes more advanced, humans are challenged to comprehend and retrace how the algorithm came to a result. Explainable AI is a set of processes and methods that enables human users to interpret, comprehend and trust the results and output created by algorithms. Fairness and inclusion Although machine learning, by its very nature, is a form of statistical discrimination, the discrimination becomes objectionable when it places privileged groups at systematic advantage and certain unprivileged groups at systematic disadvantage, potentially causing varied harms. To encourage fairness, practitioners can try to minimize algorithmic bias across data collection and model design, and to build more diverse and inclusive teams. Robustness and security Robust AI effectively handles exceptional conditions, such as abnormalities in input or malicious attacks, without causing unintentional harm. It is also built to withstand intentional and unintentional interference by protecting against exposed vulnerabilities. Accountability and transparency Organizations should implement clear responsibilities and governance structures for the development, deployment and outcomes of AI systems. In addition, users should be able to see how an AI service works, evaluate its functionality, and comprehend its strengths and limitations. Increased transparency provides information for AI consumers to better understand how the AI model or service was created. Privacy and compliance Many regulatory frameworks, including GDPR, mandate that organizations abide by certain privacy principles when processing personal information. It is crucial to be able to protect AI models that might contain personal information, control what data goes into the model in the first place, and to build adaptable systems that can adjust to changes in regulation and attitudes around AI ethics. Weak AI vs. Strong AI In order to contextualize the use of AI at various levels of complexity and sophistication, researchers have defined several types of AI that refer to its level of sophistication: Weak AI : Also known as \u201cnarrow AI,\u201d defines AI systems designed to perform a specific task or a set of tasks. Examples might include \u201csmart\u201d voice assistant apps, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Apple\u2019s Siri, a social media chatbot or the autonomous vehicles promised by Tesla. Strong AI : Also known as \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d (AGI) or \u201cgeneral AI,\u201d possess the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to or surpassing human intelligence . This level of AI is currently theoretical and no known AI systems approach this level of sophistication. Researchers argue that if AGI is even possible, it requires major increases in computing power. Despite recent advances in AI development, self-aware AI systems of science fiction remain firmly in that realm. History of AI The idea of \"a machine that thinks\" dates back to ancient Greece. But since the advent of electronic computing (and relative to some of the topics discussed in this article) important events and milestones in the evolution of AI include the following: 1950 Alan Turing publishes Computing Machinery and Intelligence . In this paper, Turing famous for breaking the German ENIGMA code during WWII and often referred to as the \"father of computer science\" asks the following question: \"Can machines think?\" From there, he offers a test, now famously known as the \"Turing Test,\" where a human interrogator would try to distinguish between a computer and human text response. While this test has undergone much scrutiny since it was published, it remains an important part of the history of AI, and an ongoing concept within philosophy as it uses ideas around linguistics. 1956 John McCarthy coins the term \"artificial intelligence\" at the first-ever AI conference at Dartmouth College. (McCarthy went on to invent the Lisp language.) Later that year, Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw and Herbert Simon create the Logic Theorist, the first-ever running AI computer program. 1967 Frank Rosenblatt builds the Mark 1 Perceptron, the first computer based on a neural network that \"learned\" through trial and error. Just a year later, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert publish a book titled Perceptrons, which becomes both the landmark work on neural networks and, at least for a while, an argument against future neural network research initiatives. 1980 Neural networks, which use a backpropagation algorithm to train itself, became widely used in AI applications. 1995 Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig publish Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach , which becomes one of the leading textbooks in the study of AI. In it, they delve into four potential goals or definitions of AI, which differentiates computer systems based on rationality and thinking versus acting. 1997 IBM's Deep Blue beats then world chess champion Garry Kasparov, in a chess match (and rematch). 2004 John McCarthy writes a paper, What Is Artificial Intelligence? , and proposes an often-cited definition of AI. By this time, the era of big data and cloud computing is underway, enabling organizations to manage ever-larger data estates, which will one day be used to train AI models. 2011 IBM Watson\u00ae beats champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter at Jeopardy! Also, around this time, data science begins to emerge as a popular discipline. 2015 Baidu's Minwa supercomputer uses a special deep neural network called a convolutional neural network to identify and categorize images with a higher rate of accuracy than the average human. 2016 DeepMind's AlphaGo program, powered by a deep neural network, beats Lee Sodol, the world champion Go player, in a five-game match. The victory is significant given the huge number of possible moves as the game progresses (over 14.5 trillion after just four moves). Later, Google purchased DeepMind for a reported USD 400 million. 2022 A rise in large language models or LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, creates an enormous change in performance of AI and its potential to drive enterprise value. With these new generative AI practices, deep-learning models can be pretrained on large amounts of data. 2024 The latest AI trends point to a continuing AI renaissance. Multimodal models that can take multiple types of data as input are providing richer, more robust experiences. These models bring together computer vision image recognition and NLP speech recognition capabilities. Smaller models are also making strides in an age of diminishing returns with massive models with large parameter counts.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that enable computers to perform a variety of advanced functions, including the ability to see , understand and translate spoken and written language , analyze data , make recommendations, and more. AI is the backbone of innovation in modern computing, unlocking value for individuals and businesses. For example, optical character recognition (OCR ) uses AI to extract text and data from images and documents, turns unstructured content into business-ready structured data, and unlocks valuable insights.

Get started for free Stay informed 22:01 Introduction to generative AI Artificial intelligence defined Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze. AI is a broad field that encompasses many different disciplines, including computer science, data analytics and statistics, hardware and software engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, and even philosophy and psychology. On an operational level for business use, AI is a set of technologies that are based primarily on machine learning and deep learning, used for data analytics, predictions and forecasting, object categorization, natural language processing, recommendations, intelligent data retrieval, and more. How does AI work? While the specifics vary across different AI techniques, the core principle revolves around data. AI systems learn and improve through exposure to vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and relationships that humans may miss. This learning process often involves algorithms, which are sets of rules or instructions that guide the AI's analysis and decision-making. In machine learning, a popular subset of AI, algorithms are trained on labeled or unlabeled data to make predictions or categorize information. Deep learning , a further specialization, utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to process information, mimicking the structure and function of the human brain. Through continuous learning and adaptation, AI systems become increasingly adept at performing specific tasks, from recognizing images to translating languages and beyond. Want to learn how to get started with AI? Take the free beginner's introduction to generative AI . Types of artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence can be organized in several ways, depending on stages of development or actions being performed. For instance, four stages of AI development are commonly recognized. Reactive machines: Limited AI that only reacts to different kinds of stimuli based on preprogrammed rules. Does not use memory and thus cannot learn with new data. IBM\u2019s Deep Blue that beat chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 was an example of a reactive machine. Limited memory: Most modern AI is considered to be limited memory. It can use memory to improve over time by being trained with new data, typically through an artificial neural network or other training model. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is considered limited memory artificial intelligence. Theory of mind: Theory of mind AI does not currently exist, but research is ongoing into its possibilities. It describes AI that can emulate the human mind and has decision-making capabilities equal to that of a human, including recognizing and remembering emotions and reacting in social situations as a human would. Self aware: A step above theory of mind AI, self-aware AI describes a mythical machine that is aware of its own existence and has the intellectual and emotional capabilities of a human. Like theory of mind AI, self-aware AI does not currently exist. A more useful way of broadly categorizing types of artificial intelligence is by what the machine can do. All of what we currently call artificial intelligence is considered artificial \u201cnarrow\u201d intelligence, in that it can perform only narrow sets of actions based on its programming and training. For instance, an AI algorithm that is used for object classification won\u2019t be able to perform natural language processing. Google Search is a form of narrow AI, as is predictive analytics, or virtual assistants. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) would be the ability for a machine to \u201csense, think, and act\u201d just like a human. AGI does not currently exist. The next level would be artificial superintelligence (ASI), in which the machine would be able to function in all ways superior to a human. Artificial intelligence training models When businesses talk about AI, they often talk about \u201ctraining data.\u201d But what does that mean? Remember that limited-memory artificial intelligence is AI that improves over time by being trained with new data. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to train data to obtain results. In broad strokes, three kinds of learnings models are often used in machine learning: Supervised learning is a machine learning model that maps a specific input to an output using labeled training data (structured data). In simple terms, to train the algorithm to recognize pictures of cats, feed it pictures labeled as cats. Unsupervised learning is a machine learning model that learns patterns based on unlabeled data (unstructured data). Unlike supervised learning, the end result is not known ahead of time. Rather, the algorithm learns from the data, categorizing it into groups based on attributes. For instance, unsupervised learning is good at pattern matching and descriptive modeling. In addition to supervised and unsupervised learning, a mixed approach called semi-supervised learning is often employed, where only some of the data is labeled. In semi-supervised learning, an end result is known, but the algorithm must figure out how to organize and structure the data to achieve the desired results. Reinforcement learning is a machine learning model that can be broadly described as \u201clearn by doing.\u201d An \u201cagent\u201d learns to perform a defined task by trial and error (a feedback loop) until its performance is within a desirable range. The agent receives positive reinforcement when it performs the task well and negative reinforcement when it performs poorly. An example of reinforcement learning would be teaching a robotic hand to pick up a ball. Common types of artificial neural networks A common type of training model in AI is an artificial neural network, a model loosely based on the human brain. A neural network is a system of artificial neurons\u2014sometimes called perceptrons\u2014that are computational nodes used to classify and analyze data. The data is fed into the first layer of a neural network, with each perceptron making a decision, then passing that information onto multiple nodes in the next layer. Training models with more than three layers are referred to as \u201cdeep neural networks\u201d or \u201cdeep learning.\u201d Some modern neural networks have hundreds or thousands of layers. The output of the final perceptrons accomplish the task set to the neural network, such as classify an object or find patterns in data. Some of the most common types of artificial neural networks you may encounter include: Feedforward neural networks (FF) are one of the oldest forms of neural networks, with data flowing one way through layers of artificial neurons until the output is achieved. In modern days, most feedforward neural networks are considered \u201cdeep feedforward\u201d with several layers (and more than one \u201chidden\u201d layer). Feedforward neural networks are typically paired with an error-correction algorithm called \u201cbackpropagation\u201d that, in simple terms, starts with the result of the neural network and works back through to the beginning, finding errors to improve the accuracy of the neural network. Many simple but powerful neural networks are deep feedforward. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) differ from feedforward neural networks in that they typically use time series data or data that involves sequences. Unlike feedforward neural networks, which use weights in each node of the network, recurrent neural networks have \u201cmemory\u201d of what happened in the previous layer as contingent to the output of the current layer. For instance, when performing natural language processing, RNNs can \u201ckeep in mind\u201d other words used in a sentence. RNNs are often used for speech recognition, translation, and to caption images. Long/short term memory (LSTM) is an advanced form of RNN that can use memory to \u201cremember\u201d what happened in previous layers. The difference between RNNs and LSTM is that LSTM can remember what happened several layers ago, through the use of \u201cmemory cells.\u201d LSTM is often used in speech recognition and making predictions. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) include some of the most common neural networks in modern artificial intelligence. Most often used in image recognition, CNNs use several distinct layers (a convolutional layer, then a pooling layer) that filter different parts of an image before putting it back together (in the fully connected layer). The earlier convolutional layers may look for simple features of an image, such as colors and edges, before looking for more complex features in additional layers. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) involve two neural networks competing against each other in a game that ultimately improves the accuracy of the output. One network (the generator) creates examples that the other network (the discriminator) attempts to prove true or false. GANs have been used to create realistic images and even make art. Benefits of AI Automation AI can automate workflows and processes or work independently and autonomously from a human team. For example, AI can help automate aspects of cybersecurity by continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic. Similarly, a smart factory may have dozens of different kinds of AI in use, such as robots using computer vision to navigate the factory floor or to inspect products for defects, create digital twins, or use real-time analytics to measure efficiency and output. Reduce human error AI can eliminate manual errors in data processing, analytics, assembly in manufacturing, and other tasks through automation and algorithms that follow the same processes every single time. Eliminate repetitive tasks AI can be used to perform repetitive tasks, freeing human capital to work on higher impact problems. AI can be used to automate processes, like verifying documents, transcribing phone calls, or answering simple customer questions like \u201cwhat time do you close?\u201d Robots are often used to perform \u201cdull, dirty, or dangerous\u201d tasks in the place of a human. Fast and accurate AI can process more information more quickly than a human, finding patterns and discovering relationships in data that a human may miss. Infinite availability AI is not limited by time of day, the need for breaks, or other human encumbrances. When running in the cloud, AI and machine learning can be \u201calways on,\u201d continuously working on its assigned tasks. Accelerated research and development The ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly can lead to accelerated breakthroughs in research and development. For instance, AI has been used in predictive modeling of potential new pharmaceutical treatments, or to quantify the human genome.

Definition, Uses, and Types What Is Artificial Intelligence? Definition, Uses, and Types Written by Coursera Staff \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Updated on Aug 14, 2025 Learn what artificial intelligence actually is, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used today, and what it may do in the future. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of performing complex tasks that historically only humans could do, such as reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems.\u00c2 Today, the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI\u00e2\u0080\u009d describes a wide range of technologies that power many of the services and goods we use every day \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from apps that recommend TV shows to chatbots that provide customer support in real time. In this article, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn more about artificial intelligence, what it actually does, and the different types. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also learn about some of its benefits and dangers and explore flexible courses that can help you expand your knowledge of AI even further.\u00c2 If you're ready to start building your AI skills, consider enrolling in the IBM AI Foundations for Everyone Specialization , where you'll gain a firm understanding of what AI is, its applications, and use cases across various industries. What is artificial intelligence? Artificial intelligence (AI) is the theory and development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns. AI is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of technologies, including machine learning , deep learning , and natural language processing (NLP) .\u00c2 Although the term is commonly used to describe a range of different technologies in use today, many disagree on whether these actually constitute artificial intelligence. Instead, some argue that much of the technology used in the real world today actually constitutes highly advanced machine learning that is simply a first step towards true artificial intelligence, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cgeneral artificial intelligence\u00e2\u0080\u009d (GAI). Despite the many philosophical disagreements over whether \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrue\u00e2\u0080\u009d intelligent machines actually exist, when most people use the term AI today, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re referring to a suite of machine learning-powered technologies, such as Chat GPT or computer vision, that enable machines to perform tasks that previously only humans can do like generating written content, steering a car, or analyzing data.\u00c2 What does AI stand for? AI stands for \"artificial intelligence.\" Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, such as computer systems. AI powers many technology-driven industries, such as health care, finance, transportation, and much more. Read more: What Does AI Stand For? Artificial intelligence examples\u00c2 Though the humanoid robots often associated with AI (think Star Trek: The Next Generation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Data or Terminator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00c2 T-800) don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist yet, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve likely interacted with machine learning-powered services or devices many times before.\u00c2 At the simplest level, machine learning uses algorithms trained on data sets to create machine learning models that allow computer systems to perform tasks like making song recommendations, identifying the fastest way to travel to a destination, or translating text from one language to another. Some of the most common examples of AI in use today include:\u00c2 ChatGPT : Uses large language models (LLMs) to generate text in response to questions or comments posed to it.\u00c2 Google Translate: Uses deep learning algorithms to translate text from one language to another.\u00c2 Netflix: Uses machine learning algorithms to create personalized recommendation engines for users based on their previous viewing history.\u00c2 Tesla: Uses computer vision to power self-driving features on their cars.\u00c2 The increasing accessibility of generative AI tools has made it an in-demand skill for many tech roles . If you're interested in learning to work with AI for your career, you might consider a free, beginner-friendly online program like Google's Introduction to Generative AI . AI in the workforce Artificial intelligence is prevalent across many industries. Automating tasks that don't require human intervention saves money and time, and can reduce the risk of human error. Here are a couple of ways AI could be employed in different industries: Finance industry. Fraud detection is a notable use case for AI in the finance industry. AI's capability to analyze large amounts of data enables it to detect anomalies or patterns that signal fraudulent behavior. Health care industry. AI-powered robotics could support surgeries close to highly delicate organs or tissue to mitigate blood loss or risk of infection. Subscribe to our weekly newsletter Career Chat . It's a low-commitment way to stay current with industry trends and skills you can use to guide your career path. What is artificial general intelligence (AGI)?\u00c2 Artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to a theoretical state in which computer systems will be able to achieve or exceed human intelligence. In other words, AGI is \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrue\u00e2\u0080\u009d artificial intelligence, as depicted in countless science fiction novels, television shows, movies, and comics.\u00c2 As for the precise meaning of \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI\u00e2\u0080\u009d itself, researchers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite agree on how we would recognize \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrue\u00e2\u0080\u009d artificial general intelligence when it appears. However, the most famous approach to identifying whether a machine is intelligent or not is known as the Turing Test or Imitation Game, an experiment that was first outlined by influential mathematician, computer scientist, and cryptanalyst Alan Turing in a 1950 paper on computer intelligence. There, Turing described a three-player game in which a human \u00e2\u0080\u009cinterrogator\u00e2\u0080\u009d is asked to communicate via text with another human and a machine and judge who composed each response. If the interrogator cannot reliably identify the human, then Turing says the machine can be said to be intelligent [ 1 ].\u00c2 Want to build your AI skills? Enroll in AI for Everyone , an online program offered by DeepLearning.AI. In just 6 hours , you'll gain foundational knowledge about AI terminology , strategy , and the workflow of machine learning projects . Your first week is free . To complicate matters, researchers and philosophers also can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite agree whether we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re beginning to achieve AGI, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still far off, or just totally impossible. For example, while a recent paper from Microsoft Research and OpenAI argues that Chat GPT-4 is an early form of AGI, many other researchers are skeptical of these claims and argue that they were just made for publicity [ 2 , 3 ]. Regardless of how far we are from achieving AGI , you can assume that when someone uses the term artificial general intelligence, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re referring to the kind of sentient computer programs and machines that are commonly found in popular science fiction.\u00c2 Strong AI vs. Weak AI When researching artificial intelligence, you might have come across the terms \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cweak\u00e2\u0080\u009d AI. Though these terms might seem confusing, you likely already have a sense of what they mean.\u00c2 Strong AI is essentially AI that is capable of human-level, general intelligence. In other words, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just another way to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cartificial general intelligence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2 Weak AI , meanwhile, refers to the narrow use of widely available AI technology, like machine learning or deep learning, to perform very specific tasks, such as playing chess, recommending songs, or steering cars. Also known as Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), weak AI is essentially the kind of AI we use daily. Read more: Machine Learning vs. AI: Differences, Uses, and Benefits The four types of AI\u00c2 As researchers attempt to build more advanced forms of artificial intelligence, they must also begin to formulate more nuanced understandings of what intelligence or even consciousness precisely mean. In their attempt to clarify these concepts, researchers have outlined four types of artificial intelligence . Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a summary of each AI type, according to Professor Arend Hintze of the University of Michigan [ 4 ]:\u00c2 1. Reactive machines Reactive machines are the most basic type of artificial intelligence. Machines built in this way don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possess any knowledge of previous events but instead only \u00e2\u0080\u009creact\u00e2\u0080\u009d to what is before them in a given moment. As a result, they can only perform certain advanced tasks within a very narrow scope, such as playing chess, and are incapable of performing tasks outside of their limited context.\u00c2 2. Limited memory machines Machines with limited memory possess a limited understanding of past events. They can interact more with the world around them than reactive machines can. For example, self-driving cars use a form of limited memory to make turns, observe approaching vehicles, and adjust their speed. However, machines with only limited memory cannot form a complete understanding of the world because their recall of past events is limited and only used in a narrow band of time.\u00c2 3. Theory of mind machines Machines that possess a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctheory of mind\u00e2\u0080\u009d represent an early form of artificial general intelligence. In addition to being able to create representations of the world, machines of this type would also have an understanding of other entities that exist within the world. As of this moment, this reality has still not materialized.\u00c2 4. Self-aware machines Machines with self-awareness are the theoretically most advanced type of AI and would possess an understanding of the world, others, and themselves. This is what most people mean when they talk about achieving AGI. Currently, this is a far-off reality.\u00c2 What is generative artificial intelligence? Generative AI is a kind of artificial intelligence capable of producing original content, such as written text or images, in response to user inputs or \"prompts.\" Generative models are also known as large language models (LLMs) because they're essentially complex, deep learning models trained on vast amounts of data that can be interacted with using normal human language rather than technical jargon. Generative AI is becoming increasingly common in everyday life, powering tools such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot. While other kinds of machine learning models are well suited for performing narrow, repetitive tasks, generative AI is capable of responding to user inputs with unique outputs that allow it to respond dynamically in real-time. This makes it particularly useful for powering interactive programs like virtual assistants, chatbots , and recommendation systems. That said, while generative AI may produce responses that make it seem like self-aware AI, the reality is that its responses are the result of statistical analysis rather than sentience. Read more: Generative AI Examples and How the Technology Works AI benefits and dangers AI has a range of applications with the potential to transform how we work and live. While many of these transformations are exciting, like self-driving cars, virtual assistants, or wearable devices in the healthcare industry, they also pose many challenges. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a complicated picture that often summons competing images: a utopia for some, a dystopia for others. The reality is likely to be much more complex. Here are a few of the possible benefits and dangers AI may pose:\u00c2 Potential Benefits Potential Dangers Greater accuracy for certain repeatable tasks, such as assembling vehicles or computers. Job loss due to increased automation. Decreased operational costs due to greater efficiency of machines. Potential for bias or discrimination as a result of the data set on which the AI is trained. Increased personalization within digital services and products. Possible cybersecurity concerns. Improved decision-making in certain situations. Lack of transparency over how decisions are arrived at, resulting in less than optimal solutions. Ability to quickly generate new content, such as text or images. Potential to create misinformation, as well as inadvertently violate laws and regulations. These are just some of the ways that AI benefits and harms society. When using new technologies like AI, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to be clear about what it is and isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t and pay attention to the evolving landscape of AI ethics . After all, with great power comes great responsibility.\u00c2 Build AI skills on Coursera Artificial Intelligence is quickly changing the world we live in.
