Subpart S\u2014General Compliance Provisions for Control of Air Pollution From New and In-Use Light-Duty Vehicles, Light-Duty Trucks, and Heavy-Duty Vehicles Source: 64 FR 23925 , May 4, 1999, unless otherwise noted. \u00a7 86.1801-12 Applicability. ( a ) Applicability. The provisions of this subpart apply to certain types of new vehicles as described in this paragraph (a) . Where the provisions apply for a type of vehicle, they apply for vehicles powered by any fuel, unless otherwise specified. In cases where a provision applies only to a certain vehicle group based on its model year, vehicle class, motor fuel, engine type, or other distinguishing characteristics, the limited applicability is cited in the appropriate section. Testing references in this subpart generally apply to Tier 2 and older vehicles, while testing references to 40 CFR part 1066 generally apply to Tier 3 and newer vehicles; see \u00a7 86.101 for detailed provisions related to this transition. The provisions of this subpart apply to certain vehicles as follows: ( 1 ) The provisions of this subpart apply for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. ( 2 ) The provisions of this subpart apply for medium-duty passenger vehicles. The provisions of this subpart also apply for medium-duty vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR, except as follows: ( i ) The provisions of this subpart are optional for diesel-cycle vehicles through model year 2017; however, if you are using the provisions of \u00a7 86.1811-17(b)(9) or \u00a7 86.1816-18(b)(8) to transition to the Tier 3 exhaust emission standards, the provisions of this subpart are optional for those diesel-cycle vehicles until the start of the Tier 3 phase-in for those vehicles. ( ii ) The exhaust emission standards of this part are optional for vehicles above 22,000 pounds GCWR and for all incomplete medium-duty vehicles. Certain requirements in this subpart apply for such vehicles even if they are not certified to the exhaust emission standards of this subpart as follows: ( A ) Such vehicles remain subject to the evaporative and refueling emission standards of this subpart. ( B ) Such vehicles may remain subject to the greenhouse gas standards in \u00a7 86.1819-14 as specified in 40 CFR 1036.635 . ( C ) Such vehicles may remain subject to onboard diagnostic requirements a specified in 40 CFR 1036.110 . ( iii ) The provisions of this subpart are optional for diesel-fueled Class 3 heavy-duty vehicles in a given model year if those vehicles are equipped with engines certified to the appropriate standards in \u00a7 86.007-11 or 40 CFR 1036.104 for which less than half of the engine family's sales for the model year in the United States are for complete Class 3 heavy-duty vehicles. This includes engines sold to all vehicle manufacturers. If you are the original manufacturer of the engine and the vehicle, base this showing on your sales information. If you manufacture the vehicle but are not the original manufacturer of the engine, you must use your best estimate of the original manufacturer's sales information. ( 3 ) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to heavy-duty vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR (see \u00a7 86.016-1 and 40 CFR parts 1036 and 1037 ), except as follows: ( i ) Heavy-duty vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR may be optionally certified to the exhaust emission standards in this subpart, including the greenhouse gas emission standards, if they are properly included in a test group with similar vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR. Emission standards apply to these vehicles as if they were Class 3 medium-duty vehicles. The work factor for these vehicles may not be greater than the largest work factor that applies for vehicles in the test group that are at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR (see \u00a7 86.1819-14 ). ( ii ) The greenhouse gas standards apply for certain vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR as specified in \u00a7 86.1819-14 . ( iii ) Evaporative and refueling emission standards apply for heavy-duty vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR as specified in 40 CFR 1037.103 . ( 4 ) If you optionally certify vehicles to standards under this subpart, those vehicles are subject to all the regulatory requirements as if the standards were mandatory. ( b ) Relationship to 40 CFR parts 1036 and 1037 . If any heavy-duty vehicle is not subject to standards and certification requirements under this subpart, the vehicle and its installed engine are instead subject to standards and certification requirements under 40 CFR parts 1036 and 1037 , as applicable. If you optionally certify engines or vehicles to standards under 40 CFR part 1036 or 40 CFR part 1037 , respectively, those engines or vehicles are subject to all the regulatory requirements in 40 CFR parts 1036 and 1037 as if they were mandatory. Note that heavy-duty engines subject to greenhouse gas standards under 40 CFR part 1036 before model year 2027 are also subject to standards and certification requirements under subpart A of this part 86. ( c ) Clean alternative fuel conversions. The provisions of this subpart also apply to clean alternative fuel conversions as defined in 40 CFR 85.502 of all vehicles described in paragraph (a) of this section. ( d ) Small-volume manufacturers. Special certification procedures are available for small-volume manufacturers as described in \u00a7 86.1838 . ( e ) You. The term \u201cyou\u201d in this subpart refers to manufacturers subject to the emission standards and other requirements of this subpart. ( f ) Vehicle. The term \u201cvehicle\u201d, when used generically, does not exclude any type of vehicle for which the regulations apply (such as light-duty trucks). ( g ) Complete and incomplete vehicles. Several provisions in this subpart, including the applicability provisions described in this section, are different for complete and incomplete vehicles. We differentiate these vehicle types as described in 40 CFR 1037.801 . ( h ) Applicability of provisions of this subpart to light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, medium-duty passenger vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles. Numerous sections in this subpart provide requirements or procedures applicable to a \u201cvehicle\u201d or \u201cvehicles.\u201d Unless otherwise specified or otherwise determined by the Administrator, the term \u201cvehicle\u201d or \u201cvehicles\u201d in those provisions apply equally to light-duty vehicles (LDVs), light-duty trucks (LDTs), medium-duty passenger vehicles (MDPVs), and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), as those terms are defined in \u00a7 86.1803-01 . Note that this subpart also identifies heavy-duty vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR that are not medium-duty passenger vehicles as medium-duty vehicles. ( i ) Types of pollutants. Emission standards and related requirements apply for different types of pollutants as follows: ( 1 ) Criteria pollutants. Criteria pollutant standards apply for NO X , NMOG, HC, formaldehyde, PM, and CO, including exhaust, evaporative, and refueling emission standards. These pollutants are sometimes described collectively as \u201ccriteria pollutants\u201d because they are either criteria pollutants under the Clean Air Act or precursors to the criteria pollutants ozone and PM. ( 2 ) Greenhouse gas emissions. This subpart contains standards and other regulations applicable to the emission of the air pollutant defined as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. ( 3 ) Nomenclature. Numerous sections in this subpart refer to requirements relating to \u201cexhaust emissions.\u201d Unless otherwise specified or otherwise determined by the Administrator, the term \u201cexhaust emissions\u201d refers at a minimum to emissions of all pollutants described by emission standards in this subpart, including carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and methane (CH 4 ). ( j ) Exemption from greenhouse gas emission standards for small businesses. Manufacturers that qualify as a small business under the Small Business Administration regulations in 13 CFR part 121 are exempt from certain standards and associated provisions as specified in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1815 , 86.1818 , and 86.1819 and in 40 CFR part 600 . This exemption applies to both U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based businesses. The following categories of businesses (with their associated NAICS codes) may be eligible for exemption based on the Small Business Administration size standards in 13 CFR 121.201 : ( 1 ) Vehicle manufacturers (NAICS code 336111). ( 2 ) Independent commercial importers (NAICS codes 811111, 811112, 811198, 423110, 424990, and 441120). ( 3 ) Alternate fuel vehicle converters (NAICS codes 335312, 336312, 336322, 336399, 454312, 485310, and 811198). ( k ) Conditional exemption from greenhouse gas emission standards. Manufacturers may request a conditional exemption from compliance with the emission standards described in \u00a7 86.1818-12(c) through (e) and associated provisions in this part and in part 600 of this chapter for model years 2012 through 2016. For the purpose of determining eligibility the sales of related companies shall be aggregated according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1838-01(b)(3) or, if a manufacturer has been granted operational independence status under \u00a7 86.1838-01(d) , eligibility shall be based on that manufacturer's vehicle production. ( 1 ) [Reserved] ( 2 ) Maintaining eligibility for exemption from greenhouse gas emission standards. To remain eligible for exemption under this paragraph (k) the manufacturer's average sales for the three most recent consecutive model years must remain below 5,000. If a manufacturer's average sales for the three most recent consecutive model years exceeds 4999, the manufacturer will no longer be eligible for exemption and must meet applicable emission standards according to the provisions in this paragraph (k)(2) . ( i ) If a manufacturer's average sales for three consecutive model years exceeds 4999, and if the increase in sales is the result of corporate acquisitions, mergers, or purchase by another manufacturer, the manufacturer shall comply with the emission standards described in \u00a7 86.1818-12(c) through (e) , as applicable, beginning with the first model year after the last year of the three consecutive model years. ( ii ) If a manufacturer's average sales for three consecutive model years exceeds 4999 and is less than 50,000, and if the increase in sales is solely the result of the manufacturer's expansion in vehicle production, the manufacturer shall comply with the emission standards described in \u00a7 86.1818-12(c) through (e) , as applicable, beginning with the second model year after the last year of the three consecutive model years. ( iii ) If a manufacturer's average sales for three consecutive model years exceeds 49,999, the manufacturer shall comply with the emission standards described in \u00a7 86.1818-12(c) through (e) , as applicable, beginning with the first model year after the last year of the three consecutive model years. [ 89 FR 28157 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1802-01 Section numbering; construction. ( a ) Section numbering. The model year of initial applicability is indicated by the section number. The two digits following the hyphen designate the first model year for which a section is applicable. The section continues to apply to subsequent model years unless a later model year section is adopted. Example: Section 86.18xx-10 applies to model year 2010 and later vehicles. If a \u00a7 86.18xx-17 is promulgated, it would apply beginning with the 2017 model year; \u00a7 86.18xx-10 would apply only to model years 2010 through 2016, except as specified in \u00a7 86.18xx-17 . ( b ) A section reference without a model year suffix refers to the section applicable for the appropriate model year. ( c ) If a regulation in this subpart references a section that has been superseded or no longer exists, this should be understood as a reference to the same section for the appropriate model year. For example, if a regulation in this subpart refers to \u00a7 86.1845-01 , it should be taken as a reference to \u00a7 86.1845-04 or any later version of \u00a7 86.1845 that applies for the appropriate model year. However, this does not apply if the reference to a superseded section specifically states that the older provision applies instead of any updated provisions from the section in effect for the current model year; this occurs most often as part of the transition to new emission standards.

Also, a mobile command center that is unable to manually regenerate its DPF while on duty could be an emergency vehicle. In making this determination, we may consider any factor that has an effect on the totality of the actual risk to human life. For example, we may consider how frequently a vehicle will be used in emergency situations or how likely it is that the emission controls will cause a significant risk to human life when the vehicle is used in emergency situations.

( b ) Manufacturers may elect to optionally certify a test group to the Tier 2 exhaust emission standards for 150,000 miles to gain additional NO X credits, as permitted in \u00a7 86.1860-04(g) , or to opt out of intermediate life standards as permitted in \u00a7 86.1811-04(c) . In such cases, useful life is a period of use of 15 years or 150,000 miles, whichever occurs first, for all exhaust, evaporative and refueling emission requirements except for cold CO standards and standards which are applicable only at the time of certification. ( c ) Where intermediate useful life exhaust emission standards are applicable, such standards are applicable for five years or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first. ( d ) Where cold CO standards are applicable, the useful life requirement for compliance with the cold CO standard only, is 5 years or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first. [ 75 FR 25685 , May 7, 2010] \u00a7 86.1805-17 Useful life. ( a ) General provisions. The useful life values specified in this section apply for all exhaust, evaporative, refueling, and OBD emission requirements described in this subpart, except for standards that are specified to apply only at certification. These useful life requirements also apply to all air conditioning leakage credits, air conditioning efficiency credits, and other credit programs used by the manufacturer to comply with the fleet-average CO 2 emission standards in \u00a7 86.1818 . Useful life values are specified as a given number of calendar years or miles of driving, whichever comes first. ( b ) Greenhouse gas pollutants. The emission standards in \u00a7 86.1818 apply for a useful life of 10 years or 120,000 miles for LDV and LLDT and 11 years or 120,000 miles for HLDT and MDPV. For non-MDPV heavy-duty vehicles, the emission standards in \u00a7 86.1819 apply for a useful life of 11 years or 120,000 miles through model year 2020, and for a useful life of 15 years or 150,000 miles in model year 2021 and later. Manufacturers may certify based on the useful life as specified in paragraph (d) of this section if it is different than the useful life specified in this paragraph (b) . ( c ) Cold temperature emission standards. The cold temperature NMHC emission standards in \u00a7 86.1811-17 apply for a useful life of 10 years or 120,000 miles for LDV and LLDT, and 11 years or 120,000 miles for HLDT and HDV. The cold temperature CO emission standards in \u00a7 86.1811-17 apply for a useful life of 5 years or 50,000 miles. ( d ) Criteria pollutants. The useful life provisions of this paragraph (d) apply for all emission standards not covered by paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. This paragraph (d) applies for the cold temperature emission standards in \u00a7 86.1811-27(c) . Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section and in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811 , 86.1813 , and 86.1816 , the useful life for LDT2, HLDT, MDPV, and HDV is 15 years or 150,000 miles. The useful life for LDV and LDT1 is 10 years or 120,000 miles. Manufacturers may optionally certify LDV and LDT1 to a useful life of 15 years or 150,000 miles, in which case the longer useful life would apply for all the standards and requirements covered by this paragraph (d) . ( e ) Intermediate useful life. Where exhaust emission standards are specified for an intermediate useful life, these standards apply for five years or 50,000 miles. [ 79 FR 23708 , Apr. 28, 2014, as amended at 80 FR 9104 , Feb. 19, 2015; 81 FR 73983 , Oct. 25, 2016; 89 FR 28160 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1806-17 Onboard diagnostics. Model year 2017 and later vehicles must have onboard diagnostic (OBD) systems as described in this section. OBD systems must generally detect malfunctions in the emission control system, store trouble codes corresponding to detected malfunctions, and alert operators appropriately. ( a ) Vehicles must comply with the 2013 OBD requirements adopted for California as described in this paragraph (a) . California's 2013 OBD-II requirements are part of Title 13, \u00a7 1968.2 of the California Code of Regulations, approved on July 31, 2013 (incorporated by reference in \u00a7 86.1 ). We may approve your request to certify an OBD system meeting a later version of California's OBD requirements if you demonstrate that it complies with the intent of this section. The following clarifications and exceptions apply for vehicles certified under this subpart: ( 1 ) For vehicles not certified in California, references to vehicles meeting certain California Air Resources Board emission standards are understood to refer to the corresponding EPA emission standards for a given family, where applicable. Use good engineering judgment to correlate the specified standards with the bin standards that apply under this subpart. ( 2 ) Vehicles must comply with OBD requirements throughout the useful life as specified in \u00a7 86.1805 . If the specified useful life is different for evaporative and exhaust emissions, the useful life specified for evaporative emissions applies for monitoring related to fuel-system leaks and the useful life specified for exhaust emissions applies for all other parameters. ( 3 ) The purpose and applicability statements in 13 CCR 1968.2(a) and (b) do not apply. ( 4 ) The anti-tampering provisions in 13 CCR 1968.2(d)(1.4) do not apply. ( 5 ) The requirement to verify proper alignment between the camshaft and crankshaft described in 13 CCR 1968.2(e)(15.2.1)(C) applies only for vehicles equipped with variable valve timing. ( 6 ) The deficiency provisions described in paragraph (c) of this section apply instead of 13 CCR 1968.2(k). ( 7 ) For emergency vehicles only, the provisions of 13 CCR 1968.2(e)(6.2.1) related to monitoring and identification of air-fuel ratio cylinder imbalance, as part of the fuel system monitoring, do not apply until model year 2020, unless the vehicle met the requirements in 2016 or earlier model years. ( 8 ) Apply thresholds for exhaust emission malfunctions from Tier 3 vehicles based on the thresholds calculated for the corresponding bin standards in the California LEV II program as prescribed for the latest model year in 13 CCR 1968.2(e) and (f). For example, for Tier 3 Bin 160 standards, apply the threshold that applies for the LEV standards. For cases involving Tier 3 standards that have no corresponding bin standards from the California LEV II program, use the next highest LEV II bin. For example, for Tier 3 Bin 50 standards, apply the threshold that applies for the ULEV standards. You may apply thresholds that are more stringent than we require under this paragraph (a)(8) . ( 9 ) Apply thresholds as specified in 40 CFR 1036.110(b)(5) for engines certified to emission standards under 40 CFR part 1036 . ( b ) The following additional provisions apply: ( 1 ) Model year 2017 and later vehicles must meet the OBD system requirements described in this paragraph (b)(1) . When monitoring conditions are satisfied, test vehicles must detect the presence of a leak with an effective leak diameter at or above 0.020 inches, illuminate the MIL, and store the appropriate confirmed diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) (13 CCR 1968.2 refers to these as fault codes). For a 0.020 inch leak, the DTC(s) shall be a generic SAE J2012 DTC that is specific to an EVAP system very small leak (e.g., P0456, P04EE, or P04EF) or an equivalent manufacturer-specific DTC that we approve. Conduct testing using an O'Keefe Controls Co. metal \u201cType B\u201d orifice with a diameter of 0.020 inches or an alternate orifice diameter approved under 13 CCR 1968.2(e)(4.2.3) or (e)(4.2.4). ( i ) Use the methodology specified in 13 CCR 1968.2(h)(2.2) to select test vehicles to demonstrate that the OBD system is capable of detecting a 0.020 inch leak installed in the evaporative system, except that the manufacturer may use production-representative vehicles instead of the vehicle options specified in 13 CCR 1968.2(h)(2.3). ( ii ) Perform tests in the laboratory, with or without a dynamometer, or on an outdoor road surface, as necessary to exercise the vehicle's ability to detect leaks in the evaporative system. ( iii ) Perform at least two tests to evaluate the OBD system for leaks that are installed near the fuel fill pipe and near the canister. The implanted leak near the fuel fill pipe must be at the fuel cap or between the fuel cap and the fuel tank. The implanted leak near the canister must be in the vapor line between the canister and the fuel tank, or between the canister and the purge valve). If a vehicle has multiple canisters or fuel fill pipes, repeat the testing to evaluate the system for implanted leaks corresponding to each canister and fuel fill pipe. You may propose to implant leaks in different locations (e.g., near the purge valve); we will approve your alternate leak location if it more effectively demonstrates leak detection for your particular fuel system design. ( iv ) If vehicle operation is needed to fulfill preconditioning (i.e., when engine-off tests require driving before vehicle shutdown to enable the engine-off monitor) or monitoring conditions for leak detection under this paragraph (b)(1) utilize an FTP cycle, Unified cycle, or some other specified operating cycle that will satisfy the approved monitoring or preconditioning conditions without the interference of approved deficiencies. Continue vehicle operation as needed to illuminate the MIL and store the appropriate DTCs. ( v ) Emission measurements are not required during this OBD evaporative system leak monitoring demonstration testing. ( vi ) For test groups not selected for testing in a given model year, you may instead provide a statement in the application for certification, consistent with good engineering judgment, that vehicles meet leak-detection requirements based on previous OBD tests, development tests, or other appropriate information. For any untested test groups, the statement specified in \u00a7 86.1844-01(d)(8) applies with regard to the leak monitoring requirement. We may ask you to provide the data and other information that formed the basis for your statement. Select test groups in later model years such that testing will rotate to cover your whole product line over time. ( vii ) Submit the following information in the application for certification: ( A ) Describe the test sequence. ( B ) Identify the driving cycle used and the time expired and distance driven before the MIL illuminated. ( C ) Identify the ranges of in-use environmental and vehicle operating conditions for which the vehicle will not meet the leak-detection specifications described in this paragraph (b)(1) . To meet this requirement, you may give us the same information you gave the California Air Resources Board regarding enable conditions for the evaporative system leak monitor. ( D ) Identify the confirmed and permanent DTCs set by the OBD system during testing. ( E ) Include the freeze frame information stored at the point the fault is detected. ( F ) Include the SAE J1979 test results (e.g., Mode/Service $06) corresponding to the DTCs that were stored during the test. ( viii ) If you have one or more vehicle models in model year 2016 that do not comply with the leak requirements in 13 CCR 1968.2(e)(4), you may comply with the requirements of this paragraph (b)(1) in model year 2017 by substituting model year 2016 vehicles on an equal-percentage basis. Demonstrate this by calculating the percentage of vehicles subject to OBD requirements under this subpart that meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(1) in model years 2016 and 2017; the sum of these two percentage values must be at or above 100 percent. Any model year 2017 vehicles not meeting the requirements of this paragraph (b)(1) , as allowed by this paragraph (b)(1)(viii) , may not be counted as compliant Tier 3 vehicles under the alternative phase-in specified in \u00a7 86.1813-17(g)(2)(ii) . ( 2 ) For vehicles subject to the leak standard in \u00a7 86.1813 , OBD systems must record in computer memory the result of the most recent successfully completed diagnostic check for a 0.020 inch leak. Someone must be able to use the data to determine the miles driven since the last check occurred, the pass/fail result, and whether there has been a check since the computer memory was last cleared (e.g., from a scan tool command or battery disconnect). The system may be designed to keep data only from the previous 750 miles of driving. (Note: This 750 mile requirement is related to the use of the OBD evaporative leak monitor in the leak test and should not be confused with either the minimum or maximum distance values specified in Table G-19 of SAE J1979.) The data must be reported in a standardized format consistent with other data required for the OBD system. The results must be scan-readable. ( 3 ) For vehicles with fuel tanks exceeding 25 gallons nominal fuel tank capacity, you may request our approval for a leak threshold greater than 0.020 inches, up to a maximum value of 0.040 inches. We will generally approve a leak threshold equal to the standard that applies under \u00a7 86.1813 . ( 4 ) For vehicles with installed compression-ignition engines that are subject to standards and related requirements under 40 CFR 1036.104 and 1036.111 , you must comply with the following additional requirements: ( i ) Make parameters related to engine derating and other inducements available for reading with a generic scan tool as specified in 40 CFR 1036.110(b)(9)(vi) . ( ii ) Design your vehicles to display information related to engine derating and other inducements in the cab as specified in 40 CFR 1036.110(c)(1) and 1036.601(c) . ( c ) You may ask us to accept as compliant a vehicle that does not fully meet specific requirements under this section. Such deficiencies are intended to allow for minor deviations from OBD standards under limited conditions. We expect vehicles to have functioning OBD systems that meet the objectives stated in this section. The following provisions apply regarding OBD system deficiencies: ( 1 ) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, we will not approve a deficiency that involves the complete lack of a major diagnostic monitor, such as monitors related to exhaust aftertreatment devices, oxygen sensors, air-fuel ratio sensors, NO X sensors, engine misfire, evaporative leaks, and diesel EGR (if applicable). ( 2 ) We will approve a deficiency only if you show us that full compliance is infeasible or unreasonable considering any relevant factors, such as the technical feasibility of a given monitor, or the lead time and production cycles of vehicle designs and programmed computing upgrades. ( 3 ) Our approval for a given deficiency applies only for a single model year, though you may continue to ask us to extend a deficiency approval in renewable one-year increments. We may approve an extension if you demonstrate an acceptable level of effort toward compliance and show that the necessary hardware or software modifications would pose an unreasonable burden. ( d ) For alternative-fuel vehicles, manufacturers may request a waiver from specific requirements for which monitoring may not be reliable for operation with the alternative fuel. However, we will not waive requirements that we judge to be feasible for a particular manufacturer or vehicle model. ( e ) Onboard diagnostic requirements apply for alternative-fuel conversions as described in 40 CFR part 85, subpart F . ( f ) You may ask us to waive certain requirements in this section for emergency vehicles. We will approve your request for an appropriate duration if we determine that the OBD requirement in question could harm system performance in a way that would impair a vehicle's ability to perform its emergency functions. ( g ) The following interim provisions describe an alternate implementation schedule for the requirements of this section in certain circumstances: ( 1 ) Manufacturers may delay complying with all the requirements of this section, and instead meet all the requirements that apply under \u00a7 86.1806-05 , for any heavy-duty vehicles that are not yet subject to the Tier 3 standards in \u00a7 86.1816 . ( 2 ) Except as specified in this paragraph (g)(2) , small-volume manufacturers may delay complying with all the requirements of this section until model year 2022, and instead meet all the requirements that apply under \u00a7 86.1806-05 during those years. This provision does not apply for a vehicle model if it is identical to a 2016 vehicle model that was certified to meet California's OBD requirements under \u00a7 86.1806-05(j)(3) . A vehicle model is considered identical to one from model year 2016 if it is certified in the current year based on the same test data for exhaust or evaporative emissions under the carryover data provisions of this subpart. ( 3 ) Manufacturers may disregard the requirements of this section that apply above 8,500 pounds GVWR before model year 2019 and instead meet all the requirements that apply under \u00a7 86.1806-05 . This also applies for model year 2019 vehicles from a test group with vehicles that have a Job 1 date on or before March 3, 2018 (see 40 CFR 85.2304 ).

Model year 2027 and later vehicles must have onboard diagnostic (OBD) systems as described in this section. OBD systems must generally detect malfunctions in the emission control system, store trouble codes corresponding to detected malfunctions, and alert operators appropriately. Vehicles may optionally comply with the requirements of this section instead of the requirements of \u00a7 86.1806-17 before model year 2027. ( a ) Vehicles must comply with the 2022 OBD requirements adopted for California as described in this paragraph (a) . California's 2022 OBD-II requirements are part of Title 13, section 1968.2 of the California Code of Regulations, operative November 30, 2022 (incorporated by reference, see \u00a7 86.1 ). We may approve your request to certify an OBD system meeting a later version of California's OBD requirements if you demonstrate that it complies with the intent of this section. The following clarifications and exceptions apply for vehicles certified under this subpart: ( 1 ) For vehicles not certified in California, references to vehicles meeting certain California Air Resources Board emission standards are understood to refer to the corresponding EPA emission standards for a given family, where applicable. Use good engineering judgment to correlate the specified standards with the bin standards that apply under this subpart. ( 2 ) Vehicles must comply with OBD requirements throughout the useful life as specified in \u00a7 86.1805 . If the specified useful life is different for evaporative and exhaust emissions, the useful life specified for evaporative emissions applies for monitoring related to fuel-system leaks and the useful life specified for exhaust emissions applies for all other parameters. ( 3 ) The purpose and applicability statements in 13 CCR 1968.2(a) and (b) do not apply. ( 4 ) The anti-tampering provisions in 13 CCR 1968.2(d)(1.4) do not apply. ( 5 ) The requirement to verify proper alignment between the camshaft and crankshaft described in 13 CCR 1968.2(e)(15.2.1)(C) applies only for vehicles equipped with variable valve timing. ( 6 ) The deficiency provisions described in paragraph (c) of this section apply instead of 13 CCR 1968.2(k). ( 7 ) Apply thresholds for exhaust emission malfunctions from Tier 4 vehicles based on the thresholds calculated for the corresponding bin standards in the California LEV program as prescribed for the latest model year in 13 CCR 1968.2(d). For example, for Tier 4 Bin 10 standards, apply the threshold that applies for the LEV standards. For cases involving Tier 4 standards that have no corresponding bin standards from the California LEV program, use the monitor threshold for the next highest LEV bin. For example, for Tier 4 Bin 5 and Bin 10 standards, apply a threshold of 50 mg/mile (15 mg/mile \u00d7 3.33). You may apply thresholds that are more stringent than we require under this paragraph (a)(7) . ( 8 ) Apply thresholds and testing requirements as specified in 40 CFR 1036.110(b)(5) , (6) and (11) for engines certified to emission standards under 40 CFR part 1036 . ( b ) For vehicles with installed compression-ignition engines that are subject to standards and related requirements under 40 CFR 1036.104 and 1036.111 , you must comply with the following additional requirements: ( 1 ) Make parameters related to engine derating and other inducements available for reading with a generic scan tool as specified in 40 CFR 1036.110(b)(9)(vi) . ( 2 ) Design your vehicles to display information related to engine derating and other inducements in the cab as specified in 40 CFR 1036.110(c)(1) and 1036.601(c) . ( c ) You may ask us to accept as compliant a vehicle that does not fully meet specific requirements under this section. Such deficiencies are intended to allow for minor deviations from OBD standards under limited conditions. We expect vehicles to have functioning OBD systems that meet the objectives stated in this section.

However, we will not waive requirements that we judge to be feasible for a particular manufacturer or vehicle model. ( e ) OBD-related requirements for alternative-fuel conversions apply as described in 40 CFR part 85, subpart F . ( f ) You may ask us to waive certain requirements in this section for emergency vehicles. We will approve your request for an appropriate duration if we determine that the OBD requirement in question could harm system performance in a way that would impair a vehicle's ability to perform its emergency functions. ( g ) The following interim provisions describe an alternate implementation schedule for the requirements of this section in certain circumstances: ( 1 ) Manufacturers may delay complying with all the requirements of this section, and instead meet all the requirements that apply under \u00a7 86.1806-17 for any vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR that are not yet subject to all the Tier 4 standards in \u00a7 86.1811 . ( 2 ) Except as specified in this paragraph (g)(2) , small-volume manufacturers may delay complying with all the requirements of this section until model year 2030, and instead meet all the requirements that apply under \u00a7 86.1806-17 during those years.

( vii ) Any other information deemed necessary by the Administrator to determine the adequacy of a manufacturer Web site. ( 19 ) Prohibited Acts, Liability and Remedies. ( i ) It is a prohibited act for any person to fail to promptly provide or cause a failure to promptly provide information as required by this paragraph (f) , or to otherwise fail to comply or cause a failure to comply with any provision of this paragraph (f) . ( ii ) Any person who fails or causes the failure to comply with any provision of this paragraph (f) is liable for a violation of that provision. A corporation is presumed liable for any violations of this subpart that are committed by any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or parents that are substantially owned by it or substantially under its control. ( iii ) Any person who violates a provision of this paragraph (f) shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $32,500 per day for each violation. This maximum penalty is shown for calendar year 2004. Maximum penalty limits for later years may be set higher based on the Consumer Price Index, as specified in 40 CFR part 19 . In addition, such person shall be liable for all other remedies set forth in Title II of the Clean Air Act, remedies pertaining to provisions of Title II of the Clean Air Act, or other applicable provisions of law. ( g ) Through model year 2013, the manufacturer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the purchaser the following statement for each new diesel-fueled Tier 2 vehicle (certified using a test fuel with 15 ppm sulfur or less): \u201cThis vehicle must be operated only with ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (that is, diesel fuel meeting EPA specifications for highway diesel fuel, including a 15 ppm sulfur cap).\u201d [ 64 FR 23925 , May 4, 1999, as amended at 68 FR 38455 , June 27, 2003; 70 FR 40442 , July 13, 2005; 79 FR 23711 , Apr. 28, 2014; 89 FR 28161 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1809-12 Prohibition of defeat devices. ( a ) No new vehicle shall be equipped with a defeat device. ( b ) EPA may test or require testing on any vehicle at a designated location, using driving cycles and conditions that may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation and use, for the purposes of investigating a potential defeat device. ( c ) For cold temperature CO, NMHC, and NMOG+NO X emission control, EPA will use a guideline to determine the appropriateness of the CO emission control and the NMHC or NMOG+NO X emission control at ambient temperatures between 25 \u00b0F (the upper bound of the range for cold temperature testing) and 68 \u00b0F (the lower bound of the FTP test temperature range). The guideline for CO and NMOG+NO X emission congruity across the intermediate temperature range is the linear interpolation between the CO or NMOG+NO X standard applicable at 25 \u00b0F and the corresponding standard applicable at 68 \u00b0F. The guideline for NMHC emission congruity across the intermediate temperature range is the linear interpolation between the NMHC FEL pass limit ( e.g., 0.3499 g/mi for a 0.3 g/mi FEL) applicable at 20 \u00b0F and the Tier 2 NMOG standard or the Tier 3 or Tier 4 NMOG+NO X bin standard to which the vehicle was certified at 68 \u00b0F, where the intermediate temperature NMHC level is rounded to the nearest 0.01 g/mile for comparison to the interpolated line. The following provisions apply for vehicles that exceed the specified emission guideline during intermediate temperature testing: ( 1 ) If the CO emission level is greater than the 20 \u00b0F emission standard, the vehicle will automatically be considered to be equipped with a defeat device without further investigation. If the intermediate temperature NMHC or NMOG+NO X emission level, rounded to the nearest 0.01 g/mile or the nearest 10 mg/mile, is greater than the 20 \u00b0F FEL pass limit, the vehicle will be presumed to have a defeat device unless the manufacturer provides evidence to EPA's satisfaction that the cause of the test result in question is not due to a defeat device. ( 2 ) If the conditions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply, EPA may investigate the vehicle design for the presence of a defeat device under paragraph (d) of this section. ( d ) The following provisions apply for vehicle designs EPA designates for investigation as possible defeat devices: ( 1 ) The manufacturer must show to EPA's satisfaction that the vehicle design does not incorporate strategies that unnecessarily reduce emission control effectiveness exhibited over the driving cycles specified in this subpart, the fuel economy test procedures in 40 CFR part 600 , or the air conditioning efficiency test in 40 CFR 1066.845 , when the vehicle is operated under conditions that may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation and use. ( 2 ) [Reserved] ( 3 ) The following information requirements apply: ( i ) Upon request by EPA, the manufacturer must provide an explanation containing detailed information regarding test programs, engineering evaluations, design specifications, calibrations, on-board computer algorithms, and design strategies incorporated for operation both during and outside of the Federal emission test procedures. ( ii ) For purposes of investigation of possible cold temperature CO, NMHC, or NMOG+NO X defeat devices under this paragraph (d) , the manufacturer must provide an explanation to show to EPA's satisfaction that CO emissions and NMHC or NMOG+NO X emissions are reasonably controlled in reference to the linear guideline across the intermediate temperature range. ( e ) For each test group the manufacturer must submit an engineering evaluation with the Part II certification application demonstrating to EPA's satisfaction that a discontinuity in emissions of non-methane organic gases, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, nitrous oxide, methane, and formaldehyde measured on the Federal Test Procedure ( 40 CFR 1066.801(c)(1) ) and on the Highway Fuel Economy Test Procedure ( 40 CFR 1066.801(c)(5) ) does not occur in the temperature range of 20 to 86 \u00b0F. [ 89 FR 28161 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1810-01 General standards; increase in emissions; unsafe conditions; waivers. This section applies to model year 2001 and later light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks fueled by gasoline, diesel, methanol, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas fuels. This section also applies to MDPVs and complete heavy-duty vehicles certified according to the provisions of this subpart. Multi-fueled vehicles (including dual-fueled and flexible-fueled vehicles) shall comply with all requirements established for each consumed fuel (or blend of fuels in the case of flexible fueled vehicles). The standards of this subpart apply to both certification and in-use vehicles unless otherwise indicated. For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, this section also applies to hybrid electric vehicles and zero emission vehicles. Unless otherwise specified, requirements and provisions of this subpart applicable to methanol fueled vehicles are also applicable to Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 ethanol fueled vehicles. ( a ) Any device, system or element of design installed on or incorporated in a new motor vehicle to enable such vehicle to conform to the standards imposed by this subpart: ( 1 ) Shall not in its operation or function cause the emission into the ambient air of any noxious or toxic substance that would not be emitted in the operation of such vehicle without such system, except as specifically permitted by regulation; and ( 2 ) Shall not in its operation, function or malfunction result in any unsafe condition endangering the vehicle, its occupants, or persons or property in close proximity to the vehicle. ( b ) In establishing the physically adjustable range of each adjustable parameter on a new motor vehicle, the manufacturer shall ensure that, taking into consideration the production tolerances, safe vehicle drive ability characteristics are available within that range, as required by section 202(a)(4) of the Clean Air Act. ( c ) Every manufacturer of new motor vehicles subject to any of the standards imposed by this subpart shall, prior to taking any of the actions specified in section 203(a)(1) of the Act, test or cause to be tested motor vehicles (or motor vehicle engines) in accordance with good engineering judgment to ascertain that such test vehicles will meet the requirements of this section for the useful life of the vehicle. ( d ) Crankcase emissions prohibited. No crankcase emissions shall be discharged into the ambient atmosphere from any 2001 and later model year light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or complete heavy-duty vehicle certified according to the provisions of this subpart.

The evaporative emission standards specified in \u00a7 86.1811-04(e) continue to apply at high-altitude conditions for 2009 and later model year vehicles. ( g ) The standards set forth in this part refer to test procedures set forth in subparts B , C , O and P of this part . ( h ) For methanol-fueled and natural gas-fueled vehicles, hydrocarbon standards refer to hydrocarbon equivalents and nonmethane hydrocarbon standards refer to nonmethane hydrocarbon equivalents. ( i ) Supplemental FTP general provisions. ( 1 ) Implementation schedules. A minimum of the percentage of a manufacturer's model year sales of light-duty vehicles or light light-duty trucks (considered independently) shown in Table S01-1 and heavy light-duty trucks shown in Table S01-2 shall not exceed the applicable SFTP standards found in paragraph (b) of \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811-01 , 1812-01 , 1813-01 , 1814-02 , and 1815-02 when tested under the applicable procedures in subpart B of this part . Tables S01-1 and S01-2 follow: Table S01-1\u2014SFTP Implementation Schedule for Light-Duty Vehicles and Light Light-Duty Trucks Model year Percentage 2000 40 2001 80 2002 100 Table S01-2\u2014SFTP Implementation Schedule for Heavy Light-Duty Trucks Model year Percentage 2002 40 2003 80 2004 100 ( 2 ) Optionally, a minimum of the percentage shown in Table S01-1 of a manufacturer's combined sales of the applicable model year's light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks shall not exceed the applicable SFTP standards. Under this option, the light-duty vehicles shall not exceed the applicable SFTP standards in \u00a7 86.1811-01(b) , and the light light-duty trucks shall not exceed the applicable SFTP standards in \u00a7 86.1812-01(b) or \u00a7 86.1813-01(b) as applicable. ( 3 ) Sales percentages for the purposes of determining compliance with the applicable SFTP emission standards shall be based on total actual U.S. sales of light-duty vehicles of the applicable model year by a manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, broker, or any other entity which comprises the point of first sale. If the option of paragraph (i)(2) of this section is taken, such sales percentages shall be based on the total actual combined U.S. sales of light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks of the applicable model year by a manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, broker, or any other entity which comprises the point of first sale. ( 4 ) The SFTP standards do not apply to vehicles or trucks certified on alternative fuels, but the standards do apply to the gasoline and diesel fuel operation of flexible fuel vehicles and trucks and dual fuel vehicles and trucks. ( 5 ) The SFTP standards do not apply to vehicles or trucks tested at high altitude. ( 6 ) The air to fuel ratio shall not be richer at any time than the leanest air to fuel mixture required to obtain maximum torque (lean best torque), plus a tolerance of six percent. The Administrator may approve a manufacturer's request for additional enrichment if it can be shown that additional enrichment is needed to protect the engine or emissions control hardware. For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, this provision does not apply to enrichment that occurs upon cold start, warm-up conditions and rapid-throttle motion conditions (\u201ctip-in\u201d or \u201ctip-out\u201d conditions). ( 7 ) The requirement to use a single roll dynamometer (or a dynamometer which produces equivalent results), discussed in \u00a7\u00a7 86.108-00 , 86.118-00 , and 86.129-00 of subpart B of this part , applies to all SFTP and FTP test elements as set forth in subpart B of this part for test groups which are designated as SFTP compliant under the implementation schedules in Tables S01-1 and S01-2 in paragraph (i)(1) of this section. ( 8 ) Small volume provisions. ( i ) Light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks manufactured by small volume manufacturers, as described in \u00a7 86.1801-01(d) , are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph until model year 2002, when 100 percent compliance with the provisions of this paragraph (i) and the SFTP standards in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811-01(b) and 86.1812 -01(b) is required. This exemption does not apply to small volume test groups as defined in \u00a7 86.1838-01(b)(2) . ( ii ) Heavy light-duty trucks manufactured by small volume manufacturers, as defined in \u00a7 86.1801-01 , are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph (i) until model year 2004 when 100 percent compliance with the provisions of this paragraph and the SFTP standards in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1814-02(b) and 86.1815 -02(b) is required. This exemption does not apply to small volume test groups as defined in \u00a7 86.1838-01(b)(2) . ( 9 ) [Reserved] ( 10 ) The manufacturer must state at the time of Application for Certification, based on projected U.S. sales or projected production for U.S. sale, which test groups will be used to attain the required implementation schedule sales percentages for certification purposes. ( 11 ) A manufacturer cannot use one set of test groups to meet its intermediate useful life standards and another to meet its full useful life standards. The same test groups which are used to meet the intermediate useful life standards will be required to meet the corresponding full useful life standards. ( 12 ) Compliance with composite standards shall be demonstrated using the calculations set forth in \u00a7 86.164-00 . ( 13 ) A/C-on specific calibrations. ( i ) For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, A/C-on specific calibrations (e.g. air to fuel ratio, spark timing, and exhaust gas recirculation), may be used which differ from A/C-off calibrations for given engine operating conditions (e.g., engine speed, manifold pressure, coolant temperature, air charge temperature, and any other parameters). ( ii ) Such calibrations must not unnecessarily reduce the NMHC + NO X emission control effectiveness during A/C-on operation when the vehicle is operated under conditions which may reasonably be expected to be encountered during normal operation and use. ( iii ) If reductions in control system NMHC + NO X effectiveness do occur as a result of such calibrations, the manufacturer must, in the Application for Certification, specify the circumstances under which such reductions do occur, and the reason for the use of such calibrations resulting in such reductions in control system effectiveness. ( iv ) A/C-on specific \u201copen-loop\u201d or \u201ccommanded enrichment\u201d air-fuel enrichment strategies (as defined below), which differ from A/C-off \u201copen-loop\u201d or \u201ccommanded enrichment\u201d air-fuel enrichment strategies, may not be used, with the following exceptions: Cold-start and warm-up conditions, or, subject to Administrator approval, conditions requiring the protection of the vehicle, occupants, engine, or emission control hardware. Other than these exceptions, such strategies which are invoked based on manifold pressure, engine speed, throttle position, or other engine parameters must use the same engine parameter criteria for the invoking of this air-fuel enrichment strategy and the same degree of enrichment regardless of whether the A/C is on or off. \u201cOpen-loop\u201d or \u201ccommanded\u201d air-fuel enrichment strategy is defined as enrichment of the air to fuel ratio beyond stoichiometry for the purposes of increasing engine power output and the protection of engine or emissions control hardware. However, \u201cclosed-loop biasing,\u201d defined as small changes in the air-fuel ratio for the purposes of optimizing vehicle emissions or driveability, must not be considered an \u201copen-loop\u201d or \u201ccommanded\u201d air-fuel enrichment strategy. In addition, \u201ctransient\u201d air-fuel enrichment strategy (or \u201ctip-in\u201d and \u201ctip-out\u201d enrichment), defined as the temporary use of an air-fuel ratio rich of stoichiometry at the beginning or duration of rapid throttle motion, must not be considered an \u201copen-loop\u201d or \u201ccommanded\u201d air-fuel enrichment strategy. ( 14 ) \u201c Lean-on-cruise\u201d calibration strategies. ( i ) For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, the manufacturer must state in the Application for Certification whether any \u201clean-on-cruise\u201d strategies are incorporated into the vehicle design. A \u201clean-on-cruise\u201d air-fuel calibration strategy is defined as the use of an air-fuel ratio significantly greater than stoichiometry, during non-deceleration conditions at speeds above 40 mph. \u201cLean-on-cruise\u201d air-fuel calibration strategies must not be employed during vehicle operation in normal driving conditions, including A/C usage, unless at least one of the following conditions is met: ( A ) Such strategies are substantially employed during the FTP or SFTP; ( B ) Such strategies are demonstrated not to significantly reduce vehicle NMHC + NO X emission control effectiveness over the operating conditions in which they are employed; or ( C ) Such strategies are demonstrated to be necessary to protect the vehicle occupants, engine, or emission control hardware. ( ii ) If the manufacturer proposes to use a \u201clean-on-cruise\u201d calibration strategy, the manufacturer must specify the circumstances under which such a calibration would be used, and the reason or reasons for the proposed use of such a calibration. ( j ) Evaporative emissions general provisions. ( 1 ) The evaporative standards in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811-01(d) , 86.1811 -04(e), 86.1812-01(d), 86.1813-01(d), 86.1814-01(d), 86.1814-02(d), 86.1815-01(d), 1815-02(d) and 86.1816-04(d) apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles and trucks. The spitback standard also applies to newly assembled vehicles. ( 2 ) For certification testing only, manufacturers may conduct testing to quantify a level of non-fuel background emissions for an individual test vehicle. Such a demonstration must include a description of the source(s) of emissions and an estimated decay rate. The demonstrated level of non-fuel background emissions may be subtracted from evaporative emission test results from certification vehicles if approved in advance by the Administrator. ( 3 ) All fuel vapor generated in a gasoline- or methanol-fueled light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or complete heavy-duty vehicle during in-use operation shall be routed exclusively to the evaporative control system (e.g., either canister or engine purge.) The only exception to this requirement shall be for emergencies. ( 4 ) For certification purposes, where the applicable California evaporative emission standard is as stringent or more stringent than the applicable federal evaporative emission standard, the Administrator may accept California certification test data indicating compliance with the California standard to demonstrate compliance with the appropriate federal certification evaporative emission standard. The Administrator may require the manufacturer to provide comparative test data which clearly demonstrates that a vehicle meeting the California evaporative standard (when tested under California test conditions/test procedures) will also meet the appropriate federal evaporative emission standard when tested under federal test conditions/test procedures described in this part 86. ( k ) Refueling emissions general provisions \u2014 ( 1 ) Implementation schedules. ( i ) Tables S01-3, S01-4, and S01-5 in this paragraph (k)(1)(i) give the minimum percentage of a manufacturer's sales of the applicable model year's gasoline- and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle and petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and complete heavy-duty vehicles which shall be tested under the applicable procedures in subpart B of this part , and shall not exceed the standards described in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811-01(e) , 86.1811 -04(e)(3), 86.1812-01(e), 86.1813-01(e), and 86.1816-04(e). Vehicles waived from the emission standards under the provisions of paragraphs (m) and (n) of this section shall not be counted in the calculation of the percentage of compliance. Either manufacturer sales or actual production intended for sale in the United States may be used to determine combined volume, at the manufacturers option. Tables S01-3, S01-4, and S01-5 follow: Table S01-3\u2014Light-Duty Vehicles Model year Percentage 1998 a 40 1999 a 80 2000 a 100 a Note: This subpart prescribes standards for 2001 and later MY vehicles. However, the implementation phase-in periods prior to this date are included for ease of reference.

( 2 ) Determining sales percentages. Sales percentages for the purposes of determining compliance with the applicable refueling emission standards light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, medium-duty passenger vehicles, and complete heavy-duty vehicles shall be based on total actual U.S. sales of heavy light-duty trucks and complete heavy-duty vehicles of the applicable model year by a manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, broker, or any other entity which comprises the point of first sale. ( 3 ) Refueling receptacle requirements. Compressed natural gas vehicles must meet the requirements for fueling connection devices as specified in \u00a7 86.1813-17(f)(1) . ( l ) Fuel dispensing spitback testing waiver. ( 1 ) Vehicles certified to the refueling emission standards set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811-04(e) , 86.1812 -01(e), 86.1813-01(e), 86.1816-05(e) are not required to demonstrate compliance with the fuel dispensing spitback standard contained in that section provided that: ( i ) The manufacturer certifies that the vehicle inherently meets the fuel dispensing spitback standard as part of compliance with the refueling emission standard; and ( ii ) This certification is provided in writing and applies to the full useful life of the vehicle. ( 2 ) EPA retains the authority to require testing to enforce compliance and to prevent noncompliance with the fuel dispensing spitback standard. ( m ) [Reserved] ( n ) Fixed liquid level gauge waiver. Liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles which contain fixed liquid level gauges or other gauges or valves which can be opened to release fuel or fuel vapor during refueling, and which are being tested for refueling emissions, are not required to be tested with such gauges or valves open, as outlined in \u00a7 86.157-98(d)(2) , provided the manufacturer can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that such gauges or valves would not be opened during refueling in-use due to inaccessibility or other design features that would prevent or make it very unlikely that such gauges or valves could be opened. ( o ) NMOG determination procedures. Measure NMOG emissions or determine NMOG emissions based on NMHC measurements using the procedures described in 40 CFR 1066.635 . For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles fueled by gasoline, manufacturers may instead measure NMHC and multiply the result by an adjustment factor of 1.04 before comparing with the NMOG standard to determine compliance with that standard.

Multi-fueled vehicles (including dual-fueled and flexible-fueled vehicles) must comply with all requirements established for each consumed fuel (or blend of fuels in the case of flexible fueled vehicles). The standards of this subpart apply to both certification and in-use vehicles unless otherwise indicated. This section also applies to hybrid electric vehicles and zero emission vehicles. Unless otherwise specified, requirements and provisions of this subpart applicable to methanol fueled vehicles are also applicable to Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 ethanol fueled vehicles. ( a ) through ( e ) [Reserved] For guidance see \u00a7 86.1810-01 . ( f ) Altitude requirements. ( 1 ) All emission standards apply at low altitude conditions and at high altitude conditions, with the following exceptions: ( i ) The supplemental exhaust emission standards as described in \u00a7 86.1811-04(f) apply only at low altitude conditions; ( ii ) The cold temperature NMHC emission standards as described in \u00a7 86.1811-10(g) apply only at low altitude conditions; ( iii ) The evaporative emission standards specified in \u00a7 86.1811-09(e) apply at low altitude conditions. The evaporative emission standards specified in \u00a7 86.1811-04(e) continue to apply at high altitude conditions for 2009 and later model year vehicles. ( 2 ) For vehicles that comply with the cold temperature NMHC standards described in \u00a7 86.1811-10(g) and the CO 2 , N 2 O, and CH 4 exhaust emission standards described in \u00a7 86.1818-12 , manufacturers must submit an engineering evaluation indicating that common calibration approaches are utilized at high altitudes (except when there are specific high altitude calibration needs to deviate from low altitude emission control practices). Any deviation from low altitude emission control practices must be included in the auxiliary emission control device (AECD) descriptions submitted at certification. Any AECD specific to high altitude must require engineering emission data for EPA evaluation to quantify any emission impact and validity of the AECD.

The following provisions apply to all vehicles certified under this subpart: ( a ) Any device, system or element of design installed on or incorporated in a new motor vehicle to enable such vehicle to conform to the standards imposed by this subpart: ( 1 ) Shall not in its operation or function cause the emission into the ambient air of any noxious or toxic substance that would not be emitted in the operation of such vehicle without such system, except as specifically permitted by regulation; and ( 2 ) Shall not in its operation, function or malfunction result in any unsafe condition endangering the vehicle, its occupants, or persons or property in close proximity to the vehicle. ( b ) In establishing the physically adjustable range of each adjustable parameter on a new motor vehicle, the manufacturer shall ensure that, taking into consideration the production tolerances, safe vehicle drivability characteristics are available within that range. ( c ) Unless otherwise specified, the emission standards of this subpart apply equally for certification and for in-use vehicles throughout the specified useful-life period. Also, manufacturers must use good engineering judgment to determine that all of a vehicle's emission-related components are designed to operate properly throughout the specified useful-life period. ( d ) Vehicles may not discharge crankcase emissions into the ambient atmosphere. ( e ) All vehicles must have an onboard diagnostic system as described in \u00a7 86.1806 . ( f ) Emission standards apply at low-altitude conditions and at high-altitude conditions, except as noted in this subpart. ( g ) The cold temperature standards in this subpart refer to test procedures set forth in subpart C of this part and 40 CFR part 1066, subpart H . All other emission standards in this subpart rely on test procedures set forth in subpart B of this part and 40 CFR part 1066, subpart H . These procedures rely on the test specifications in 40 CFR parts 1065 and 1066 as described in subparts B and C of this part . ( h ) Multi-fueled vehicles (including dual-fueled and flexible-fueled vehicles) must comply with all the requirements established for each consumed fuel (and blend of fuels for flexible-fueled vehicles). The following specific provisions apply for flexible-fueled vehicles that operate on ethanol and gasoline: ( 1 ) For criteria exhaust emissions, we may identify the worst-case fuel blend for testing in addition to what is required for gasoline-fueled vehicles. The worst-case fuel blend may be the fuel specified in 40 CFR 1065.725 , or it may consist of a combination of the fuels specified in 40 CFR 1065.710(b) and 1065.725 . We may waive testing with the worst-case blended fuel for US06 and/or SC03 duty cycles; if we waive only SC03 testing for Tier 3 vehicles, substitute the SC03 emission result using the standard test fuel for gasoline-fueled vehicles to calculate composite SFTP emissions. ( 2 ) For evaporative and refueling emissions, test using the fuel specified in 40 CFR 1065.710(b) . ( 3 ) No additional spitback or evaporative emission testing is required beyond the emission measurements with the gasoline test fuel specified in 40 CFR 1065.710 . ( i ) Where we specify requirements based on a percentage of total sales volume in a given model year, you may instead ask us to calculate the percentage based on production volumes instead of sales volumes. ( j ) Small-volume manufacturers that modify a vehicle already certified by a different company may recertify that vehicle under this subpart S based on the vehicle supplier's compliance with fleet average standards for criteria exhaust emissions, evaporative emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions as follows: ( 1 ) The recertifying manufacturer must certify the vehicle at bin levels and family emission limits that are the same as or more stringent than the corresponding bin levels and family emission limits for the vehicle supplier. ( 2 ) The recertifying manufacturer must meet all the standards and requirements described in this subpart S, except for the fleet average standards for criteria exhaust emissions, evaporative emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions. ( 3 ) The vehicle supplier must send the small-volume manufacturer a written statement accepting responsibility to include the subject vehicles in the vehicle supplier's exhaust and evaporative fleet average calculations in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1860-17 , 86.1864-10 , and 86.1865-12 . ( 4 ) The small-volume manufacturer must describe in the application for certification how the two companies are working together to demonstrate compliance for the subject vehicles. The application must include the statement from the vehicle supplier described in paragraph (j)(3) of this section. ( 5 ) The vehicle supplier must include a statement that the vehicle supplier is including the small volume manufacturer's sales volume and emissions levels in the vehicle supplier's fleet average reports under \u00a7\u00a7 86.1860-17 , 86.1864-10 , and 86.1865-12 . ( k ) Gasoline-fueled vehicles must have a restriction in the tank filler inlet that allows inserting nozzles meeting the specifications of 40 CFR 1090.1550(a) , but not nozzles with an outside diameter greater than 2.3 centimeters.

( a ) Applicability. ( 1 ) This section contains regulations implementing emission standards for all LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs. This section applies to 2004 and later model year LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs fueled by gasoline, diesel, methanol, ethanol, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas fuels, except as noted. Additionally, this section contains provisions applicable to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and zero emission vehicles (ZEVs). Multi-fueled vehicles must comply with all requirements established for each consumed fuel. ( 2 ) This section also applies to LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs of model years prior to 2004, when manufacturers certify such vehicles to Tier 2 exhaust emission requirements to utilize alternate phase-in schedules, as allowed under paragraph (k)(6) of this section, and/or to earn early NO X credits for use in complying with the Tier 2 fleet average NO X standard which takes effect in the 2004 model year for LDV/LLDTs and 2008 for HLDT/MDPVs. ( 3 ) Except where otherwise specified, this section applies instead of \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811-01 , 86.1812-01 , 86.1813-01 , 86.1814-01 , 86.1814-02 , 86.1815-01 , and 86.1815-02 . ( 4 ) Except where otherwise specified, the provisions of this section apply equally to LDVs and all categories of LDTs, and to all MDPVs. Numerous provisions are applicable equally to HLDTs and MDPVs, as reflected by the term HLDT/MDPV. Numerous provisions apply equally to LDVs and LLDTs as reflected by the term LDV/LLDT. ( 5 ) The exhaust emission standards and evaporative emission standards of this section apply equally to certification and in-use LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs, unless otherwise specified. ( b ) Test weight. ( 1 ) Except as required in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4) of this section, or permitted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, emission testing of all LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs to determine compliance with any exhaust or evaporative emission standard set forth in this part must be on a loaded vehicle weight (LVW) basis, as that term is defined in this subpart. ( 2 ) Interim non-Tier 2 HLDTs tested to Tier 1 SFTP standards, must be tested on an adjusted loaded vehicle weight (ALVW) basis, as that term is defined in this subpart, during the SC03 element of the SFTP. ( 3 ) Except as required in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4) of this section, interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs may be tested on an ALVW basis or an LVW basis to demonstrate compliance with any exhaust or evaporative emission standard set forth in this part. ( 4 ) MDPVs certified to bin 11 standards from Tables S04-1 and -2 must be tested on an ALVW basis to demonstrate compliance with any exhaust emission standard set forth in this part. ( c ) Tier 2 FTP exhaust emission standards. Exhaust emissions from Tier 2 vehicles must not exceed the standards in Table S04-1 of this section at full useful life when tested over the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) described in subpart B of this part . Exhaust emissions from Tier 2 vehicles must not exceed the standards in Table S04-2 of this section at intermediate useful life, if applicable, when tested over the FTP. ( 1 ) For a given test group a manufacturer desires to certify to operate only on one fuel, the manufacturer must select a set of standards from the same bin (line or row) in Table S04-1 of this section for non-methane organic gases (NMOG), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO X ), formaldehyde (HCHO) and particulate matter (PM). The manufacturer must certify the test group to meet those standards, subject to all the applicable provisions of this subpart. The manufacturer must also certify the test group to meet the intermediate useful life standards (if any) in Table S04-2 of this section having the same EPA bin reference number as the chosen full useful life standards. ( 2 ) For a given test group of flexible-fueled, bi-fuel or dual fuel vehicles when operated on the alcohol or gaseous fuel they are designed to use, manufacturers must select a bin of standards from Table S04-1 of this section and the corresponding bin in Table S04-2, if any. When these flexible-fueled, bi-fuel or dual fuel vehicles are certified to operate on gasoline or diesel fuel, the manufacturer may choose to comply with the next numerically higher applicable NMOG standard, if any, above the bin which contains the standards selected for certification on the gaseous or alcohol fuel. ( 3 ) ( i ) For a given test group of flexible-fueled, bi-fuel or dual fuel vehicles certified to bin 10 in Table S04-1, when operated on the alcohol or gaseous fuel they are designed to use, manufacturers may choose to comply with an NMOG standard of 0.230 for LDV/LLDTs or 0.280 g/mi for HLDT/MDPVs at full useful life and corresponding intermediate life standards of 0.160 g/mi and 0.195 g/mi, respectively, when these flexible-fueled, bi-fuel or dual fuel vehicles are certified to operate on gasoline or diesel fuel. ( ii ) For a given test group of flexible-fueled, bi-fuel or dual fuel vehicles certified to bin 8 in Table S04-1, when operated on the alcohol or gaseous fuel they are designed to use, manufacturers may choose to comply with a NMOG standard of 0.156 g/mi for LDV/LLDTs and 0.180 for HLDT/MDPVs at full useful life and corresponding intermediate life standards of 0.125 g/mi and 0.140 g/mi, respectively, when these flexible-fueled, bi-fuel or dual fuel vehicles are certified to operate on gasoline or diesel fuel. ( 4 ) ( i ) For bins where intermediate life standards are applicable, a manufacturer may elect not to comply with such standards. Except as permitted in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the manufacturer must certify such vehicles to a useful life of 15 years or 150,000 miles, whichever occurs first, for LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs. ( ii ) A manufacturer electing not to comply with intermediate life standards, as permitted in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, may not generate additional NO X credits as described under \u00a7 86.1860-04 (g) , except as permitted in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section. ( iii ) For bins where intermediate life standards are not applicable, or are specified to be optional by paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, a manufacturer may generate additional NO X credits subject to the provisions in \u00a7 86.1860-04 (g) . ( iv ) For diesel vehicles certified to bin 9 or bin 10, intermediate life standards are optional regardless of whether the manufacturer certifies the test group to a full useful life of 120,000 miles or 150,000 miles. ( 5 ) In a given model year, an individual vehicle may not be included in both the Tier 2 program and an interim program.

( d ) Fleet average NO X Standards. ( 1 ) ( i ) For a given individual model year's sales of Tier 2 vehicles, including model years during the phase-in years of the Tier 2 standards, manufacturers must comply with a fleet average oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) standard of 0.07 grams per mile. The manufacturer must calculate its fleet average NO X emission level(s) as described in \u00a7 86.1860-04 . Up through and including model year 2008, manufacturers must calculate separate fleet average NO X emission levels for LDV/LLDTs and for HLDT/MDPVs as described in \u00a7 86.1860-04 . ( ii ) During a phase-in year, the manufacturer must comply with the 0.07 g/mi fleet average standard for the required phase-in percentage for that year as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section, or for the alternate phase-in percentage as permitted under paragraph (k)(6) of this section. ( 2 ) For Early Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs. For model years prior to 2004, where the manufacturer desires to bank early Tier 2 NO X credits as permitted under \u00a7 86.1861(c) , the manufacturer must comply with a fleet average standard of 0.07 grams per mile for its Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs. Manufacturers must determine compliance with the NO X fleet average standard according to regulations in \u00a7 86.1860-04 of this subpart . ( 3 ) For Early Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs. For model years prior to 2008, where the manufacturer desires to bank early Tier 2 NO X credits as permitted under \u00a7 86.1861(c) , the manufacturer must comply with a fleet average standard of 0.07 grams per mile for its Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs. Manufacturers must determine compliance with the NO X fleet average standard according to regulations in \u00a7 86.1860-04 . ( e ) Evaporative emission standards. Consistent with the phase-in requirements in paragraph (k) of this section, evaporative emissions from gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled, ethanol-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles must not exceed the standards in this paragraph (e) . The standards apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles. ( 1 ) Diurnal-plus-hot soak evaporative hydrocarbon standards. Hydrocarbons for LDV/LLDTs, HLDTs and MDPVs must not exceed the diurnal plus hot soak standards shown in Table S04-3 for the full three diurnal test sequence and for the supplemental two diurnal test sequence. Table S04-3 follows: Table S04-3\u2014Light-Duty Diurnal Plus Hot Soak Evaporative Emission Standards [grams per test] Vehicle category 3 day diurnal + hot soak Supplemental 2 day diurnal + hot soak LDV/LLDTs 0.95 1.2 HLDTs 1.2 1.5 MDPVs 1.4 1.75 ( 2 ) Running loss standard. Hydrocarbons for LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs measured on the running loss test must not exceed 0.05 grams per mile. ( 3 ) Refueling emission standards. Refueling emissions must not exceed the following standards: ( i ) For gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled LDV, LDT and MDPV: 0.20 grams hydrocarbon per gallon (0.053 grams per liter) of fuel dispensed. This standard also applies for diesel-fueled LDV. ( ii ) For liquefied petroleum gas-fueled LDV, LDTs and MDPVs: 0.15 grams hydrocarbon per gallon (0.04 grams per liter) of fuel dispensed. ( iii ) Refueling standards for HLDTs are subject to the phase-in requirements found in \u00a7 86.1810-01(k) . MDPVs must also comply with the phase-in requirement in \u00a7 86.1810-01(k) and must be grouped with HLDTs to determine phase-in compliance. ( 4 ) Spitback standards. For gasoline and methanol fueled LDV/Ts and MDPVs, hydrocarbons measured on the fuel dispensing spitback test must not exceed 1.0 grams hydrocarbon (carbon if methanol-fueled) per test. ( 5 ) Evaporative emission requirements for interim vehicles. ( i ) LDV/Ts not certified to meet the evaporative emission standards in this paragraph (e) as permitted under the phase-in schedule of paragraph (k) of this section, must meet applicable evaporative emission standards in \u00a7 86.1811-01 , \u00a7 86.1812-01 , \u00a7 86.1813-01 , \u00a7 86.1814-02 or \u00a7 86.1815-02 except that all LDV/Ts must meet the refueling emission standards in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. ( ii ) MDPVs not certified to meet the evaporative emission standards in this paragraph (e) as permitted under the phase-in schedule of paragraph (k) of this section, must meet applicable evaporative emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles in \u00a7 86.099-10 . ( 6 ) In cases where applicable California emission standards are as stringent or more stringent than applicable standards specified under this paragraph (e) , the Administrator may accept data indicating compliance with California standards to demonstrate compliance for certification purposes with the standards required under this paragraph (e) . The Administrator may require manufacturers to provide comparative test data to show that a vehicle meeting California standards under California test conditions and procedures will also meet the standards under this paragraph (e) when tested under test conditions and procedures in this part 86. ( f ) Supplemental exhaust emission standards for LDV/Ts. ( 1 ) Supplemental exhaust emission standards are applicable to gasoline and diesel-fueled LDV/Ts but are not applicable to MDPVs, alternative fueled LDV/Ts, or flexible fueled LDV/Ts when operated on a fuel other than gasoline or diesel. Except as otherwise specified in this paragraph (f) , manufacturers must comply with 4000 mile and full useful life SFTP standards as determined in this paragraph (f) . The 4000 mile SFTP standards must be taken from Table S04-4 and the full life SFTP standards must be calculated using the formula in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Table S04-4 follows: Table S04-4\u20144000 Mile SFTP Standards for Tier 2 and Interim Non-Tier 2 LDVs and LDTs US06 SC03 NMHC + NO X (g/mi) CO (g/mi) NMHC + NO X (g/mi) CO (g/mi) LDV/LDT1 0.14 8.0 0.20 2.7 LDT2 0.25 10.5 0.27 3.5 LDT3 0.4 10.5 0.31 3.5 LDT4 0.6 11.8 0.44 4.0 ( 2 ) ( i ) Manufacturers must calculate their applicable full useful life SFTP standards for NMHC + NO X , PM and for CO, if using the weighted CO standard. If not using the weighted CO standard, manufacturers may use the full useful life standalone Tier 1 standards for US06 and SC03. To calculate the applicable full useful life weighted NMHC + NO X , PM and CO standards, manufacturers must use the following formula: SFTP Standard = SFTP Standard 1 \u2212[0.35 \u00d7 (FTP Standard 1 \u2212Current FTP Standard)] Where: SFTP Standard = Applicable full life weighted SFTP standard for NMHC + NO X , PM or CO. The NMHC + NO X and PM standards must be rounded to two decimal places and the CO standard must be rounded to one decimal place. SFTP Standard 1 = Applicable full life Tier 1 SFTP standard for NMHC + NO X or CO from Table S04-5. For PM only, use FTP Standard 1 for SFTP Standard 1 . FTP Standard 1 = Applicable full life Tier 1 FTP standard from Table S04-6 in this paragraph (f) . For the Tier 1 NMHC + NO X standard, add the applicable NMHC and NOx standards. Current FTP Standard = Applicable full life FTP standard from Table S04-1 in paragraph (c) of this section. For the current NMHC + NO X standard, add the NMOG and NO X standards from the applicable bin. Table S04-5\u2014Tier 1 Full Useful Life SFTP Standards Vehicle category NMHC + NO X (weighted g/mi) a c CO (g/mi) b c US06 SC03 Weighted LDV/LDT1 0.91 (0.65) 11.1 (9.0) 3.7 (3.0) 4.2 (3.4) LDT2 1.37 (1.02) 14.6 (11.6) 4.9 (3.9) 5.5 (4.4) LDT3 1.44 16.9 5.6 6.4 LDT4 2.09 19.3 6.4 7.3 a Weighting for NMHC + NO X and optional weighting for CO is 0.35x(FTP) + 0.28x(US06) + 0.37x(SC03). b CO standards are stand alone for US06 and SC03 with option for a weighted standard. c Intermediate life standards are shown in parentheses for diesel LDV/LLDTs opting to calculate intermediate life SFTP standards in lieu of 4,000 mile SFTP standards as permitted under paragraph (f)(6) of this section. Table S04-6\u2014Tier 1 Full Useful Life FTP Standards (g/mi) Vehicle category NMHC a NO X a CO a PM LDV/LDT1 0.31 (0.25) 0.6 (0.4) 4.2 (3.4) 0.10 LDT2 0.40 (0.32) 0.97(0.7) 5.5 (4.4) 0.10 LDT3 0.46 0.98 6.4 0.10 LDT4 0.56 1.53 7.3 0.12 a Intermediate life standards are shown in parentheses for diesel LDV/LLDTs opting to calculate intermediate life SFTP standards in lieu of 4,000 mile SFTP standards as permitted under paragraph (f)(6) of this section. ( ii ) ( A ) Manufacturers must determine compliance with NMHC + NO X , CO and PM weighted SFTP standards calculated in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section by weighting their emission results as follows: 0.35 \u00d7 (FTP) + 0.28 \u00d7 (US06) + 0.37 \u00d7 (SC03). ( B ) The results of the calculation in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section must be rounded to one more decimal place than the applicable standard calculated in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section and then compared with that standard. ( 3 ) For interim non-Tier 2 gasoline, diesel and flexible-fueled LDT3s and LDT4s, manufacturers may, alternatively, meet the gasoline-fueled vehicle SFTP standards found in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1814-02 and 86.1815-02 , respectively. ( 4 ) Interim non-Tier 2 gasoline, diesel and flexible-fueled LDV/LLDTs certified to bin 10 FTP exhaust emission standards from Table S04-1 in paragraph (c) of this section may meet the gasoline Tier 1 SFTP requirements found at \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811-01(b) , 86.1812 -01(b), 86.1813-01(b), for LDVs, LDT1s, and LDT2s, respectively. ( 5 ) SFTP standards for PM are not applicable to interim non-Tier 2 LDV/Ts. For Tier 2 LDV/Ts, the 4000 mile PM standard is equal to the full life PM standard calculated under paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The requirements of this paragraph (f)(5) also apply to Tier 2 flexible fuel vehicles when operated on gasoline or diesel fuel. (See regulations in \u00a7 86.1829-01(b)(1)(iii)(B) regarding data submittal for PM results for gasoline vehicles.) ( 6 ) ( i ) In lieu of complying with 4000 mile SFTP standards described in this paragraph, diesel LDV/LLDTs through model year 2006, may comply instead with intermediate life SFTP standards derived from Tier 1 intermediate life SFTP standards for gasoline vehicles. ( ii ) To calculate intermediate life SFTP standards, substitute intermediate life Tier 1 FTP and SFTP values from Tables S04-5 and S04-6 in this paragraph (f) , as appropriate, for the full life values in the equation in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Substitute the applicable intermediate life standards for the full life current FTP standard. If there is no applicable intermediate life standard use the full life current FTP standard. ( iii ) A manufacturer of diesel LDV/LLDTs must declare which option it will use (4,000 mile or intermediate life standards) in Part I of its certification application. ( 7 ) For diesel vehicles certified to the bin 9 or bin 10 standards of paragraph (c) of this section, 4000 mile SFTP and intermediate life SFTP standards are optional regardless of whether the manufacturer certifies the test group to a full useful life of 120,000 miles or 150,000 miles. ( 8 ) ( i ) For model year 2007 through 2009 diesel LDVs and diesel LDT1s only, a manufacturer may optionally comply with the 4000 mile US06 NMHC + NO X standard shown in Table S04-4 for LDT2s (0.25 g/mile), instead of the standards for LDV/LDT1s (0.14 g/mile). A manufacturer choosing this option also must comply with intermediate life SFTP NMHC + NO X standards determined using the calculation described under paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section. A manufacturer choosing this option must comply with the SFTP NMHC + NO X standard determined under paragraph (f)(6)(ii) not only at intermediate life but also at full useful life and must certify such vehicles to this SFTP NMHC + NO X standard for a full useful life of 150,000 miles or 15 years, whichever occurs first. ( ii ) In Part I of its certification application for model years 2007 through 2009, a manufacturer of diesel LDV/LDT1s must declare which provision it will use (the base Tier 2 provision of paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section or the option described in paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section). ( g ) Cold temperature exhaust emission standards. These standards are applicable only to gasoline fueled LDV/Ts and MDPVs. For cold temperature exhaust emission standards, a useful life of 50,000 miles applies. ( 1 ) For LDVs and LDT1s, the standard is 10.0 grams per mile CO. ( 2 ) For LDT2s, LDT3s and LDT4s, and MDPVs the standard is 12.5 grams per mile CO. ( 3 ) These standards do not apply to interim non-Tier 2 MDPVs. ( h ) [Reserved] ( i ) Idle CO standards and references to such standards in this subpart, do not apply to any 2004 or later model year LDV, LDT, or MDPV or to any LDV, LDT or MDPV certified to Tier 2 standards before model year 2004 for purposes of generating early NO X credits or meeting the requirements of an alternative phase-in schedule that begins prior to the 2004 model year. ( j ) Highway NO X exhaust emission standard. The NO X emissions measured on the federal Highway Fuel Economy Test in 40 CFR 1066.840 must not be greater than 1.33 times the applicable FTP NO X standard to which the manufacturer certifies the test group. Both the measured emissions and the product of the NO X standard and 1.33 must be rounded to the nearest 0.01 g/mi before being compared. ( k ) Phase-in of the Tier 2 FTP exhaust and evaporative requirements; small volume manufacturer flexibilities. ( 1 ) Manufacturers must comply with the phase-in requirements in Tables S04-7 and S04-8 of this paragraph (k) for the Tier 2 FTP exhaust emission requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Separate phase-in schedules are provided for LDV/LLDTs and for HLDT/MDPVs. These requirements specify the minimum percentage of the manufacturer's LDV/LLDT and HLDT/MDPV U.S. sales, by model year, that must meet the Tier 2 requirements, including the applicable fleet average standard, for their full useful lives. As the terms LDV/LLDT and HLDT/MDVP imply, LDVs and LLDTs must be grouped together to determine compliance with these phase-in requirements and HLDTs and MDPVs must also be grouped together to determine compliance with these phase-in requirements. Tables S04-7 and S04-8 follow: Table S04-7\u2014Phase-in Percentages for LDV/LLDT Tier 2 Requirements Model year Percentage of LDV/LLDTs that must meet tier 2 requirements 2004 25 2005 50 2006 75 2007 and subsequent 100 Table S04-8\u2014Phase-in Percentages for HLDT/MDPV Tier 2 Requirements ModeL year Percentage of HLDT/MDPVs that must meet tier 2 requirements 2008 50 2009 and subsequent 100 ( 2 ) Manufacturers must also comply with the phase-in requirements in Tables S04-7 and S04-8 of this paragraph (k) for the evaporative emission requirements contained in paragraph (e) of this section. ( 3 ) Manufacturers may opt to use different LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs to meet the phase-in requirements for evaporative emissions and FTP exhaust emissions, provided that the manufacturer meets the minimum applicable phase-in requirements in Table S04-7 and Table S04-8 of this paragraph (k) for both FTP exhaust and evaporative emissions. A LDV, LDT or MDPV counted toward compliance with any phase-in requirement for FTP exhaust or evaporative standards, must comply with all applicable Tier 2 exhaust requirements or all applicable evaporative requirements, respectively, described in this section. ( 4 ) LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs not certified to meet the Tier 2 FTP exhaust requirements during model years 2004-2008, as allowed under this subpart, are subject to the provisions of paragraph (l) of this section. ( 5 ) Provisions for small volume manufacturers. ( i ) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in this part, are exempt from the Tier 2 LDV/LLDT exhaust and evaporative emissions phase-in requirements for model years 2004, 2005 and 2006 in Table S04-7 of this paragraph (k) , but must comply with the 100% requirement for the 2007 and later model years for exhaust and evaporative emissions. If not complying with Tier 2 requirements during 2004, 2005 and 2006, small volume manufacturers must comply with the requirements for interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs. ( ii ) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in this part, are exempt from the HLDT/MDPV exhaust and evaporative phase-in requirement for model year 2008 in Table S04-8 of this section but must comply with the 100% requirement for the 2009 model year. Small volume manufacturers are also exempt from the HLDT/MDPV interim fleet average NO X standard (0.20 g/mi) and its phase-in for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 model years. ( iii ) Small volume manufacturers must comply with the FTP exhaust emission standards from Tables S04-1 and 2 of paragraph (c) of this section for all HLDT/MDPVs of model years 2004 and later, except that 2004 model year HLDTs may comply with Tier 1 exhaust emission standards subject to the provisions of paragraph (l)(2)(vii) of this section, and 2004 model year MDPVs may comply with heavy-duty vehicle standards subject to the provisions of paragraph (l)(2)(viii) of this section. Small volume manufacturers must also comply with the 0.20 g/mi fleet average NO X standard for 2007 and 2008 model year HLDT/MDPVs; the Tier 2 0.07 g/mi fleet average NO X standard for the 2009 and later model year HLDT/MDPVs; and the evaporative emission standards in Table S04-3 of this section for the 2009 and later model years. ( iv ) Vehicles produced by small volume manufacturers, as defined in \u00a7 86.1838-01 , are exempt from the LDV/LLDT evaporative emissions standards in Table S09-1 of \u00a7 86.1811-09(e) for model years 2009 and 2010, but must comply with the Tier 2 evaporative emission standards in Table S04-3 in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for model years 2009 and 2010. ( v ) Vehicles produced by small volume manufacturers, as defined in \u00a7 86.1838-01 , are exempt from the HLDT/MDPV evaporative emissions standards in Table S09-1 of \u00a7 86.1811-09(e) for model years 2010 and 2011, but must comply with the Tier 2 evaporative emission standards in Table S04-3 in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for model years 2010 and 2011. ( vi ) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in \u00a7 86.1838-01 , are exempt from the LDV/LLDT cold temperature NMHC phase-in requirements in Table S10-1 of \u00a7 86.1811-10(g) for model years 2010, 2011, and 2012, but must comply with the 100% requirement for 2013 and later model years for cold temperature NMHC standards. ( vii ) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in \u00a7 86.1838-01 , are exempt from the HLDT/MDPV cold temperature NMHC phase-in requirements in Table S10-1 of \u00a7 86.1811-10(g) for model years 2012, 2013, and 2014, but must comply with the 100% requirement for 2015 and later model years for cold temperature NMHC standards. ( 6 ) ( i ) A manufacturer may elect an alternate phase-in schedule that results in 100% phase-in for LDV/LLDTs by 2007. Alternate phase-in schedules must produce a sum of at least 250% when the percentages of LDV/LLDTs certified to Tier 2 requirements for each model year from 2001 through 2007 are summed. As an example, a 10/25/50/65/100 percent phase-in that began in 2003 would have a sum of 250 percent and would be acceptable. However, a 10/25/40/70/100 percent phase-in that began the same year would have a sum of 245 percent and would not be acceptable. ( ii ) A manufacturer electing this option for LDV/LLDTs may calculate its compliance with the evaporative standards in paragraph (e)(1) of this section separately from its compliance with Tier 2 exhaust standards, provided that the phase-in schedules for each separately produce a sum of at least 250 percent when calculated as described in paragraph (k)(6)(i) of this section. A vehicle counted towards compliance with any phase-in requirement for the Tier 2 exhaust standards or the evaporative standards in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, must comply with all applicable Tier 2 exhaust standards or all evaporative standards, as applicable, described in this section. ( iii ) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (k)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section, except as permitted in paragraph (k)(6)(vii) of this section, a manufacturer of LDV/LLDTs electing to use an alternate phase-in schedule for compliance with the Tier 2 exhaust standards or the evaporative standards in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must ensure that the sum of the percentages of vehicles from model years 2001 through 2004, meeting such exhaust or evaporative standards, as applicable, is at least 25%. ( iv ) A manufacturer may elect an alternate phase-in schedule that results in 100% phase-in for HLDT/MDPVs by 2009. The requirements of paragraphs (k)(6)(i) through (k)(6)(ii) of this section apply, except that for HLDT/MDPVs, the calculation described in paragraphs (k)(6)(i) and (k)(6)(ii) of this section may cover model years 2001 through 2009 and must produce a sum of at least 150%. ( v ) A manufacturer electing to use any alternate phase-in schedule permitted under this section must provide in its Application for Certification for the first year in which it intends to use such a schedule, and in each succeeding year during the phase-in, the intended phase-in percentages for that model year and the remaining phase-in years along with the intended final sum of those percentages as described in this paragraph (k)(6) . This information may be included with the information required under \u00a7 86.1844-01(d)(13) . In its year end annual reports, as required under \u00a7 86.1844-01(e)(4) the manufacturer must include sufficient information so that the Administrator can verify compliance with the alternative phase-in schedule established under paragraph (k)(6) of this section. ( vi ) Under an alternate phase-in schedule, the projected phase-in percentage is not binding for a given model year, provided the sums of the actual phase-in percentages that occur meet the appropriate total sums as required in paragraph (k)(6) of this section, and provided that 100% actual compliance is reached for the appropriate model year, either 2007 or 2009, as described in paragraph (k)(6) of this section. ( vii ) A manufacturer unable to meet the 25% requirement in paragraph (k)(6)(iii) of this section, must: ( A ) Ensure that the sum of the percentages of vehicles for model years 2001 through 2004, meeting such exhaust or evaporative standards, as applicable, is at least 20%. ( B ) Subtract that sum of percentages for model years 2001 through 2004 from 25%, and multiply the unrounded result by 2. ( C ) Round the product from paragraph (k)(6)(vii)(B) of this section to the nearest 0.1% and add that to 50%. That sum becomes the required phase-in percentage for the 2005 model year. ( D ) Comply with the phase-in percentage for the 2005 model year determined in paragraph (k)(6)(vii)(C) of this section. ( E ) Comply with a minimum phase-in percentage for the 2006 model year determined by the following equation: minimum phase-in percentage for 2006 = [75% \u2212 (2005 api \u2212 2005 rpi )] Where: 2005 rpi = the required phase-in for the 2005 model year as determined in paragraph (k)(6)(vii)(C) of this section; and 2005 api = the manufacturer's actual phase-in quantity for the 2005 model year. ( 7 ) ( i ) Sales percentages for the purpose of determining compliance with the phase-in of the Tier 2 requirements and the phase-in of the evaporative standards in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, must be based upon projected U.S. sales of LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs of the applicable model year by the manufacturer to the point of first sale. Such sales percentages must be rounded to the nearest one tenth of a percent, and must not include vehicles and trucks projected to be sold to points of first sale in California or a state that has adopted California requirements for that model year as permitted under section 177 of the Act. ( ii ) Alternatively, the manufacturer may petition the Administrator to allow actual volume produced for U.S. sales to be used in lieu of projected U.S. sales for purposes of determining compliance with the phase-in percentage requirements under this section. The manufacturer must submit its petition within 30 days of the end of the model year to the Vehicle Programs and Compliance Division. For EPA to approve the use of actual volume produced for U.S. sales, the manufacturer must establish to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that actual production volume is functionally equivalent to actual sales volume of LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs sold in states other than California and states that have adopted California standards. ( iii ) Manufacturers must submit information showing compliance with all phase-in requirements of this section with its Part I application as required by \u00a7 86.1844(d)(13) . ( l ) FTP exhaust standards for interim non-Tier 2 vehicles \u2014 ( 1 ) FTP exhaust emission standards for interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs. ( i ) LDV/LLDTs that are not used to meet the Tier 2 phase-in requirements including the Tier 2 fleet average NO X requirement during the Tier 2 phase-in period (model years 2004-2006) must comply with the full useful life FTP exhaust emission standards listed in Table S04-1 of paragraph (c) of this section and the corresponding intermediate useful life standards, if any, in Table S04-2 of paragraph (c) of this section. Manufacturers may choose the bin of full useful life standards to which they certify a test group of vehicles, subject to the requirements in paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section. In a given model year, an individual vehicle may not be used to comply with both the Tier 2 fleet average NO X standard and the applicable interim fleet average NO X standard although vehicles from the same test group may be separated and the vehicles counted toward compliance with either program. ( ii ) The provisions of paragraphs (c) (1) , (2) and (3) of this section apply to flexible-fueled, dual fuel and multi-fuel interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs. ( iii ) Only manufacturers that comply with the applicable FTP standards in Tables S04-1 and 2 of paragraph (c) of this section for all of their 2004 model year HLDTs and declare their intention to comply with the 2004 model year 25% phase-in requirement to the 0.20 g/mi interim fleet average NO X standard for HLDTs (or HLDT/MDPVs) described in this paragraph (l) may use the optional higher NMOG values for interim LDT2s certified to bin 9 standards that are shown in Tables S04-1 and 2. Manufacturers must declare their intention to comply with the full 2004 model year 25% phase-in requirement in Part I of their HLDT or their HLDT/MDPV, as applicable, certification applications. ( iv ) The provisions of paragraph (c)(4) of this section apply to interim non-Tier 2 vehicles. ( 2 ) FTP exhaust emission standards for interim non-Tier 2 HLDTs and interim non-Tier 2 MDPVs. ( i ) Except as permitted under paragraphs (l)(2) (vii) and (viii) of this section, HLDTs and MDPVs of model years 2004-2008 that are not used to meet the Tier 2 FTP phase-in requirements including the Tier 2 fleet average NO X requirement must comply with the full useful life FTP exhaust emission standards listed in Table S04-1 of paragraph (c) of this section and, the corresponding intermediate useful life standards, if any, in Table S04-2 of paragraph (c) of this section. Manufacturers may choose the bin of full useful life standards to which they certify a test group of vehicles, subject to the requirements in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) of this section. ( ii ) Except as permitted under paragraphs (l)(2) (vii) and (viii) of this section, HLDTs and MDPVs of model years 2004-2008 that are not used to meet the Tier 2 FTP phase-in requirements including the Tier 2 fleet average NO X requirement must comply with the fleet average NO X standard described in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) of this section subject to the phase-in schedule in paragraph (l)(2)(iv) of this section, i.e. 25 percent of the HLDT and MDPVs must meet the fleet average standard of 0.20 g/mi in 2004, 50 percent in 2005, and so on. ( iii ) Manufacturers may choose the bin of full useful life standards and corresponding intermediate life standards to which they certify test groups of HLDTs and MDPVs, subject to the requirements in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) of this section. Manufacturers may include HLDT/MDPVs in the interim program that are not used to meet the Tier 2 fleet average NO X standard or the phase-in percentage requirements in the Tier 2 program or to generate Tier 2 NO X credits. In a given model year, an individual vehicle may not be used to comply with both the Tier 2 fleet average NO X standard and the applicable interim fleet average NO X standard although vehicles from the same test group may be separated and the vehicles counted toward compliance with either program. ( iv ) Phase-in schedule for interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs. Table S04-9 of this paragraph (l) specifies the minimum percentage of the manufacturer's interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPV U.S. sales, by model year, that must comply with the fleet average NO X standard described in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) of this section. Table S04-9 follows: Table S04-9\u2014Phase-in Percentages for Compliance With Interim Non-Tier 2 Fleet Average NO X Standard for HLDT/MDPVs Model year Percentage of non-tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs that must meet interim non-tier 2 fleet average NO X standard 2004 25 2005 50 2006 75 2007 and 2008 100 ( v ) ( A ) A manufacturer may elect an alternate phase-in schedule, beginning as early as the 2001 model year, that results in 100% compliance by 2007 with the fleet average NO X standard for interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs described in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) of this section. The requirements of paragraph (k)(6) of this section apply to the selection of an alternate phase-in schedule. ( B ) If a manufacturer elects not to bring all of its HLDT/MDPVs into compliance with the interim requirements in 2004 as permitted under paragraphs (l)(2)(vii) and (viii) of this section, it may still use an alternate phase-in schedule to attain 100% compliance with the interim fleet average NO X standard for HLDT/MDPVs, but the sum of phase-in percentages it must meet will be 225% rather than 250%. If the manufacturer commences its 2004 model year on or after December 21, 2003, for any HLDT/MDPVs, the manufacturer must increase the 225% by the fraction of its 2004 model year HLDT/MDPVs whose model year commenced on or after that date and which were brought into compliance with the 0.20 g/mi corporate average NO X standard as required under paragraph (l)(2)(ix) of this section. The manufacturer must ensure that the sum of the percentages of vehicles up through model year 2005 complying with the interim fleet average NO X standard is at least 50%. ( vi ) The provisions of paragraphs (c) (1) , (2) and (3) of this section apply to flexible-fueled, dual fuel and multi-fuel interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs. ( vii ) For 2004 model year HLDT test groups whose model year commences before December 21, 2003, the manufacturer may exempt such HLDTs from compliance with any requirements applicable to interim non-Tier 2 HLDTs, and such HLDTs must be produced in accordance with standards and requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1814-02 and 86.1815-02 . Such HLDTs must also meet the refueling emission standards contained in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. ( viii ) For 2004 model year heavy-duty vehicles whose model year commences before December 21, 2003, the manufacturer may exempt such vehicles from compliance with any requirements applicable to interim non-Tier 2 MDPVs. Exempted vehicles will not be considered MDPVs and must be produced in accordance with standards and requirements in \u00a7 86.099-10 . Exempted vehicles are also exempted from refueling emission standards. ( ix ) For 2004 model year HLDT and MDPV test groups whose model year commences on or after December 21, 2003, the manufacturer must comply with all interim non-Tier 2 requirements in this section. ( A ) All such vehicles, but not more than 25% of the manufacturer's total sales of 2004 model year HLDT/MDPVs must meet the interim non-Tier 2 fleet average NO X standard as described in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) of this section. ( B ) All such vehicles but not more than 40% of the manufacturer's 2004 model year HLDT/MDPVs must comply with the refueling requirements in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. ( x ) Only those manufacturers that comply with the interim non-Tier 2 FTP standards for all of their 2004 model year HLDTs and declare their intention to comply with the 2004 model year 25% phase-in requirement to the fleet average interim NO X standard for HLDTs or HLDT/MDPVs of 0.20 g/mi described in paragraph (l) of this section may use the optional higher NMOG values for interim LDT4s certified to bin 10 standards that are shown in Tables S04-1 and 2 of paragraph (c) of this section. Manufacturers must declare their intention to comply with the 2004 model year 25% phase-in requirement in Part I of their HLDT certification applications. ( xi ) Only those manufacturers that comply with the interim non-Tier 2 FTP standards for all of their 2004 model year MDPVs, and declare their intention to comply with the 2004 model year 25% phase-in requirement to the fleet average interim NO X standard for MDPVs or HLDT/MDPVs of 0.20 g/mi described in paragraph (l) of this section may: ( A ) Use the exhaust emission standards of bin 11 in Tables S04-1 and S04-2 of paragraph (c) in this section for MDPVs through model year 2008; ( B ) For diesel-fueled vehicles, certify the engines in such vehicles, through model year 2007, to provisions in this part 86 applicable to diesel-fueled heavy-duty engines of the appropriate model year. Such diesel fueled vehicles must not be included in any count or determination of compliance with the phase-in requirements applicable to interim non-Tier 2 MDPVs; and ( C ) Use the optional higher NMOG values for interim LDT4s certified to bin 10 standards that are shown in Tables S04-1 and 2. ( xii ) Manufacturers electing to comply with the provisions of paragraph (l)(2)(xi) of this section must declare their intention to comply with the 2004 model year 25% phase-in requirement to the fleet average interim NO X standard for MDPVs or HLDT/MDPVs of 0.20 g/mi in Part I of their MDPV certification applications. ( xiii ) Where diesel-fueled heavy-duty engines are used as permitted under paragraph (l)(2)(xi)(B) of this section, such engines must be treated as a separate averaging set\u2014MDPV HDDEs\u2014under the averaging, banking and trading provisions applicable to heavy-duty diesel engines. Only NO X credits generated by engine-certified diesel engines that are used in other MDPVs can be applied to these engines. Manufacturers wishing to average, bank or trade credits for MDPV HDDEs must comply with the requirements in this paragraph and with all requirements applicable to heavy-duty engine averaging, banking and trading in this part. ( 3 ) Fleet average NO X standards for interim non-Tier 2 LDV/Ts and MDPVs. ( i ) Manufacturers must comply with a fleet average full useful life NO X standard for their interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs, on an annual basis, of 0.30 grams per mile. ( ii ) Manufacturers must comply with a fleet average full useful life NO X standard for their interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs, excluding those HLDTs and MDPVs not yet covered by the phase-in requirement described in paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this section, on an annual basis, of 0.20 grams per mile. ( iii ) Manufacturers must determine their compliance with these interim fleet average NO X standards for each model year by separately computing the sales weighted average NO X level of all interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and all interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs (excluding those not yet phased in as described in paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this section), using the methodology in \u00a7 86.1860 . ( iv ) Manufacturers may generate, bank, average, trade and use interim non-Tier 2 NO X credits based on their NO X fleet average as determined under paragraph (l)(3)(iii) of this section. Unless waived or modified by the Administrator, the provisions of \u00a7 86.1861 of this part apply to the generation, banking, averaging, trading and use of credits generated by interim non-Tier 2 vehicles. NO X credits generated by interim non-Tier 2 vehicles are not subject to any discount except as required by \u00a7 86.1861-04(e) . ( m ) NMOG standards for diesel, flexible fueled and dual-fueled LDV/Ts and MDPVs. ( 1 ) For diesel fueled LDV/Ts and MDPVs, the term \u201cNMOG\u201d in both the Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 standards means non-methane hydrocarbons. ( 2 ) Flexible-fueled and dual-fuel Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles must be certified to NMOG exhaust emission standards both for operation on gasoline and on any alternate fuel they are designed to use. Manufacturers may measure NMHC in lieu of NMOG when flexible-fueled and dual-fuel vehicles are operated on gasoline, subject to the requirements of \u00a7 86.1810(p) . ( n ) Requirements for vehicles with rechargeable energy storage systems. Manufacturers must measure emissions from hybrid electric vehicles (including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) as described in 40 CFR part 1066, subpart F , except that these procedures do not apply for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles during charge-depleting operation. ( o ) NMOG measurement. ( 1 ) Manufacturers must measure NMOG emissions using the procedures described in 40 CFR 1066.635 . ( 2 ) Manufacturers must not apply reactivity adjustment factors (RAFs) to NMOG measurements. See \u00a7 86.1841 . ( p ) In-use standards. ( 1 ) Table S04-10 of this paragraph (p) contains in-use emission standards applicable only to vehicles certified to the bins shown in the table. These standards apply to in-use testing performed by the manufacturer pursuant to regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 86.1845-01 , 86.1845-04 and 86.1846-01 and to in-use testing performed by EPA. These standards do not apply to certification or Selective Enforcement Auditing. ( 2 ) These standards apply only to LDV/LLDTs produced up through the 2008 model year, and HLDT/MDPVs produced up through the 2010 model year. These standards are subject to other limitations described in paragraph (p)(3) of this section. ( 3 ) For the first model year and also for the next model year after that, in which a test group of vehicles is certified to a bin of standards to which it has not previously been certified, the standards in Table S04-10 of this paragraph (p) apply for purposes of in-use testing only. The standards apply equally to all LDV/Ts and MDPVs subject to the model year limitation in paragraph (p)(2) of this section. Table S04-10 follows: Table S04-10\u2014In-use Compliance Standards (g/mi) [Certification standards shown for reference purposes] Bin number Durability period (miles) NO X In-use NO X certification NMOG In-use NMOG certification 5 50,000 0.07 0.05 n/a 0.075 5 120,000 0.10 0.07 n/a 0.090 4 120,000 0.06 0.04 n/a 0.070 3 120,000 0.05 0.03 0.09 0.055 2 120,000 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.010 ( 4 ) For diesel vehicles certified to bin 10, separate in-use standards apply for NO X and PM emissions. These standards are determined by multiplying the applicable NO X and PM certification standards by factors of 1.2 and 1.35, respectively, and then rounding the result to one more decimal place than contained in the certification standard. The resultant standards do not apply for certification or selective enforcement auditing. ( 5 ) For diesel vehicles certified to bin 7 and bin 8 only in model years 2007 through 2009, a manufacturer may optionally comply with the bin 5 FTP PM standard shown in Table S04-1. For diesel vehicles choosing this option, separate in-use NO X standards apply at high altitude conditions as defined in \u00a7 86.1803-01 . These standards are determined by multiplying the applicable NO X certification standards by a factor of 1.2. The resultant standards apply only in-use at high altitude conditions and do not apply for certification or selective enforcement auditing. A manufacturer choosing this option must certify such vehicles to the applicable FTP NO X and PM standards for a full useful life of 150,000 miles or 15 years, whichever occurs first. A manufacturer choosing this option would not be allowed to generate additional credits as described under \u00a7 86.1860-04 (g) . ( q ) Hardship provision for small volume manufacturers. ( 1 ) A small volume manufacturer may apply for relief from any applicable final phase-in model year contained in this section. Relief will only be available to defer required compliance with a completely new set of standards, a fleet average NO X standard, and/or evaporative emission standard for 100% of affected vehicles for one model year. Thus, a small volume manufacturer that obtains relief may: ( i ) Defer 100% compliance with the fleet average NO X standard for interim LDV/LLDTs (0.30 g/mi) until 2005; ( ii ) Defer 100% compliance with the evaporative emission standards and/or fleet average NO X standard for Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs (0.07 g/mi) until 2008; ( iii ) Defer 100% compliance with the requirements that interim HLDTs and MDPVs comply with applicable emission standards shown in Tables S04-1 and S04-2, until 2005; ( iv ) Defer 100% compliance with the fleet average NO X standard for interim HLDT/MDPVs (0.20 g/mi) until 2008; and ( v ) Defer 100% compliance with the evaporative emission standards and/or fleet average NO X standard for Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs (0.07 g/mi) until 2010. ( vi ) Defer compliance with the LDV/LLDT evaporative emissions standards in Table S09-1 of \u00a7 86.1811-09(e) until 2013, and defer 100% compliance with the LDV/LLDT evaporative emissions standards in Table S09-2 of \u00a7 86.1811-09(e) until 2016. (The hardship relief may be extended one additional model year\u2014two model years total.) ( vii ) Defer compliance with the HLDT/MDPV evaporative emissions standards in Table S09-1 of \u00a7 86.1811-09(e) until 2014, and defer 100% compliance with the HLDT/MDPV evaporative emissions standards in Table S09-2 of \u00a7 86.1811-09(e) until 2016. (The hardship relief may be extended one additional model year\u2014two model years total.) ( viii ) Defer 100% compliance with the LDV/LLDT cold temperature NMHC standards in Table S10-X of \u00a7 86.1811-10(g) until 2015. (The hardship relief may be extended one additional model year\u2014two model years total.) ( ix ) Defer 100% compliance with the HLDT/MDPV cold temperature NMHC standards in Table S10-X of \u00a7 86.1811-10(g) until 2017. (The hardship relief may be extended one additional model year\u2014two model years total.) ( 2 ) Applications for relief must be in writing and must: ( i ) Be submitted before the earliest date of noncompliance; ( ii ) Include evidence that the manufacturer will incur severe economic hardship if relief is not granted; ( iii ) Include evidence that the noncompliance will occur despite the best efforts of the manufacturer to comply; and ( iv ) Include evidence that the manufacturer has made every reasonable effort to purchase credits to address the noncompliance, where applicable. ( r ) NMOG standard adjustment for direct ozone reducing devices. ( 1 ) A manufacturer may obtain NMOG credit for use in certifying to the exhaust NMOG standards listed in paragraph (c) of this section and for use in complying with the in-use standards of paragraph (p) of this section, where applicable. This credit effectively allows the manufacturer to increase the exhaust NMOG emission standards listed in these paragraphs by the amount of the applicable credit. For example, if the applicable NMOG credit was 0.01 g/mi, and the vehicle was being certified in Bin 5, as described in Table S04-1 of paragraph (c) of this section, exhaust NMOG emissions must be no greater than 0.10 g/mi, as opposed to the normal NMOG certification standard of 0.09 g/mi in Bin 5. ( 2 ) The NMOG credit must be determined through a two-step process. ( i ) The first step must determine the ozone reduction potential of the direct ozone reducing device, the ozone reduction potential of exhaust NMOG reductions beyond Bin 5 of the Tier 2 standards, and the ratio of the two methods of reducing ambient ozone levels. The requirements for this step are described in paragraph (r)(3) of this section. ( ii ) The second step must demonstrate and certify the relevant performance characteristics of the specific ozone reducing device. The requirements for this step are described in paragraph (r)(4) of this section. ( 3 ) The ozone reduction potential of the direct ozone reducing device and the ozone reduction potential of exhaust NMOG reductions beyond Bin 5 of the Tier 2 standards must be estimated using procedures which are approved by the Administrator in advance. At a minimum: ( i ) The modeling must utilize an urban airshed model using up-to-date chemical and meteorological simulation techniques; ( ii ) Four local areas must be modeled: New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and Houston; ( iii ) The ozone episodes to be modeled must meet the selection criteria established by EPA for State ozone SIPs; ( iv ) Photochemical and dispersion modeling must follow that used by EPA to project the ozone impacts of this rule, or its equivalent; ( v ) Emission projections must be made for calendar year 2007 and be consistent with those used by EPA in support of this final rule, or reflect updates approved by EPA; ( vi ) Baseline emissions (emissions prior to use of the direct ozone reducing device or the VOC emission reductions) must include the benefits of the Tier 2 emission and sulfur standards; as well as all other emission controls assumed in EPA's ozone modeling of the benefits of the Tier 2 and sulfur standards, as described in the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis to the Tier 2 and Sulfur Rule; ( vii ) The ozone benefit of the direct ozone reducing device must assume a radiator area of 0.29 square meters, an air flow velocity through the radiator of 40% of vehicle speed, and an ozone reduction efficiency of 80%, or other values as approved by the Administrator; ( viii ) The ozone level of the air entering the direct ozone reducing device must be assumed to be 40% less than that existing in the grid cell where the vehicle is located; ( ix ) The ozone benefit of VOC emission reductions must be modeled by assuming that all Tier 2 LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs meet an exhaust NMOG standard of 0.055 g/mi or lower instead of a 0.09 g/mi NMOG standard; ( x ) The ozone reducing device must be assumed to be present on all of the Tier 2 LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs modeled as meeting the more stringent NMOG standard described in paragraph (r)(3)(ix) of this section; ( xi ) The relationship between changes in exhaust NMOG emission standards and in-use VOC emissions must be determined sufficiently far in the future to ensure that the change in ozone being modeled is sufficiently large to allow comparison with the impact of the ozone reducing device; ( xii ) LDV, LDT and MDPV emissions must be modeled using the updated Tier 2 emission model developed by EPA as part of the Tier 2 rulemaking (available from EPA upon request) or MOBILE6, once this model is available; ( xiii ) The ozone benefit of the direct ozone reducing device must be the reduction in the peak one-hour ozone level anywhere in the modeled region on the day when ozone is at its highest; ( xiv ) The NMOG credit in each local area must be the reduction in peak one hour ozone associated with use of the direct ozone reducing device divided by the reduction in peak one hour ozone associated with the more stringent exhaust NMOG emission standard multiplied by the reduction the exhaust NMOG standard (in g/mi) modeled in paragraph (r)(3)(ix) of this section; and ( xv ) The NMOG credit applicable to the generic direct ozone reducing device modeled in paragraph (r)(3)(vii) of this section must be determined by arithmetically averaging the NMOG credit determined in paragraph (r)(3)(xiv) of this section for each of the four local areas. ( 4 ) The manufacturer must submit data, using procedures which have been approved by the Administrator in advance, that demonstrate the following aspects of the device being certified: ( i ) The air flowrate through the device as a function of vehicle speed; ( ii ) The ozone reduction efficiency of the device over the useful life of the vehicle for a range of vehicle speeds and ozone levels; ( iii ) The method through which the onboard diagnostic system will detect improper performance. ( 5 ) The NMOG credit for the specific application of this technology tested under the provisions of paragraph (r)(4) of this section is the four-area NMOG credit determined in paragraph (r)(3)(xv) of this section scaled based on the performance of the specific application tested under the provisions of paragraph (r)(4) of this section relative to those assumed in paragraph (r)(3)(vii) of this section. This scaling must assume a linear relationship between the NMOG credit and three aspects of the direct ozone reducing device: radiator area, average air flow through the radiator relative to vehicle speed, and ozone reduction efficiency and the NMOG credit. The NMOG credit must be rounded to the nearest 0.001 g/mi. For example, if the NMOG credit determined in paragraph (r)(3)(xv) of this section was 0.01 g/mi and the specific direct ozone reducing device being certified had an area of 0.20 square meters, an air flow velocity of 30% of vehicle speed and an ozone reducing efficiency of 70%, and the generic ozone reducing device simulated in the ozone model under paragraph (r)(3)(vii) of this section had an area of 0.29 square meters, an air flow velocity of 40% of vehicle speed and an ozone reducing efficiency of 80%, the NMOG credit applicable to the specific device being certified would be: 0.01 g/mi * (0.20/0.29) * (30%/40%) * 70%/80%) = 0.005 ( s ) Manufacturers may request to group heavy-duty vehicles into the same test group as other vehicles subject to more stringent standards, so long as all vehicles in the test group meet the most stringent standards applicable to any vehicle within that test group, as provided at \u00a7 86.1827-1(a)(5) and (d)(4) .

Section 86.1811-09 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from \u00a7 86.1811-04 . Where a paragraph in \u00a7 86.1811-04 is identical and applicable to \u00a7 86.1811-09 , this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement \u201c[Reserved]. For guidance see \u00a7 86.1811-04 .\u201d Where a corresponding paragraph of \u00a7 86.1811-04 is not applicable, this is indicated by the statement \u201c[Reserved]\u201d ( a ) Applicability. ( 1 ) This section contains regulations implementing emission standards for all LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs. This section applies to 2009 and later model year LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs fueled by gasoline, diesel, methanol, ethanol, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas fuels, except as noted. Additionally, this section applies to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and zero emission vehicles (ZEVs). Unless otherwise specified, multi-fueled vehicles must comply with all requirements established for each consumed fuel. ( 2 ) through ( 4 ) [Reserved]. For guidance see \u00a7 86.1811-04 . ( 5 ) The exhaust emission standards and evaporative emission standards of this section apply equally to certification and in-use LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs, unless otherwise specified. See paragraph (t) of this section for interim evaporative emission in-use standards that are different than the certification evaporative emission standards specified in paragraph (e) of this section. ( b ) through ( d ) [Reserved]. For guidance see \u00a7 86.1811-04 . ( e ) Evaporative emission standards. Evaporative emissions from gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled, ethanol-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles must not exceed the standards in this paragraph (e) at low altitude conditions. The evaporative emission standards specified in \u00a7 86.1811-04(e)(1) continue to apply at high altitude conditions. The standards apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles. ( 1 ) Diurnal-plus-hot soak evaporative hydrocarbon standards. ( i ) Hydrocarbons for LDV/LLDTs, HLDTs and MDPVs that are gasoline-fueled, dedicated natural gas-fueled, dedicated liquefied petroleum gas-fueled, dedicated ethanol-fueled, dedicated methanol-fueled and multi-fueled vehicles when operating on gasoline must not exceed the diurnal plus hot soak standards shown in Table S09-1 for the full three diurnal test sequence and for the supplemental two diurnal test sequence. The standards apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles, except as otherwise specified in paragraph (t) of this section. Table S09-1 follows: Table S09-1\u2014Light-Duty Diurnal Plus Hot Soak Evaporative Emission Standards [grams per test] Vehicle category Model year 3 day diurnal + hot soak Supplemental 2 day diurnal + hot soak LDVs 2009 0.50 0.65 LLDTs 2009 0.65 0.85 HLDTs 2010 0.90 1.15 MDPVs 2010 1.00 1.25 ( ii ) Hydrocarbons for LDV/LLDTs, HLDTs and MDPVs that are multi-fueled vehicles operating on non-gasoline fuel must not exceed the diurnal plus hot soak standards shown in Table S09-2 for the full three diurnal test sequence and for the supplemental two diurnal test sequence. The standards apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles except as otherwise specified in paragraph (t) of this section. Table S09-2 follows: Table S09-2\u2014Light-Duty Diurnal Plus Hot Soak Evaporative Emission Standards: Non-Gasoline Portion of Multi-Fueled Vehicles [grams per test] Vehicle category 3 day diurnal + hot soak Supplemental 2 day diurnal + hot soak LDVs 0.50 0.65 LLDTs 0.65 0.85 HLDTs 0.90 1.15 MDPVs 1.00 1.25 ( iii ) For multi-fueled vehicles operating on non-gasoline fuel, manufacturers must comply with the phase-in requirements in Table S09-3 of this paragraph for the evaporative emission requirements specified in Table S09-2 of this section. Phase-in schedules are grouped together for LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs. These requirements specify the minimum percentage of the manufacturer's LDV/LLDT/HLDT/MDPV 50-State sales, by model year, that must meet the requirements for their full useful lives. Table S09-3 follows: Table S09-3\u2014Phase-In Percentages for Light-Duty Diurnal Plus Hot Soak Evaporative Emission Standards: Non-Gasoline Portion of Multi-Fueled Vehicles Model year Percentage of vehicles that must meet evaporative emission requirements 2012 30 2013 60 2014 and subsequent 100 ( 2 ) through ( 6 ) [Reserved]. For guidance see \u00a7 86.1811-04 . ( 7 ) In cases where vehicles are certified to evaporative emission standards in Tables S09-1 and S09-2 of this section, the Administrator may accept evaporative emissions data for low altitude testing in accordance with California test conditions and test procedures (in lieu of the evaporative emission test condition and test procedure requirements of subpart B of this part ). ( f ) through ( s ) [Reserved]. For guidance see \u00a7 86.1811-04 . ( t ) Evaporative emission in-use standards. ( 1 ) For LDVs and LLDTs certified prior to the 2012 model year, the Tier 2 LDV/LLDT evaporative emissions standards in Table S04-3 of \u00a7 86.1811-04(e) shall apply to in-use vehicles for only the first three model years after an evaporative family is first certified to the LDV/LLDT evaporative emission standards in Table S09-1 of paragraph (e) of this section, as shown in Table S09-4. For example, evaporative families first certified to the LDV/LLDT standards in Table S09-1 in the 2011 model year must meet the Tier 2 LDV/LLDT evaporative emission standards (Table S04-3) in-use for 2011, 2012, and 2013 model year vehicles (applying Tier 2 standards in-use is limited to the first three years after introduction of a vehicle). ( 2 ) For HLDTs and MDPVs certified prior to the 2013 model year, the Tier 2 HLDT/MDPV evaporative emissions standards in Table S04-3 of \u00a7 86.1811-04(e) shall apply to in-use vehicles for only the first three model years after an evaporative family is first certified to the HLDT/MDPV evaporative emission standards in Table S09-1 of paragraph (e) of this section, as shown in Table S09-5. For example, evaporative families first certified to the HLDT/MDPV standards in Table S09-1 in the 2012 model year must meet the Tier 2 HLDT/MDPV evaporative emission standards (Table S04-3) in-use for 2012, 2013, and 2014 model year vehicles (applying Tier 2 standards in-use is limited to the first three years after introduction of a vehicle).

Section 86.1811-10 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811-04 and 86.1811-09 . Where a paragraph in \u00a7 86.1811-04 or \u00a7 86.1811-09 is identical and applicable to \u00a7 86.1811-10 , this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement \u201c[Reserved]. For guidance see \u00a7 86.1811-04 \u201d or \u201c[Reserved]. For guidance see \u00a7 86.1811-09 .\u201d Where a corresponding paragraph of \u00a7 86.1811-04 or \u00a7 86.1811-09 is not applicable, this is indicated by the statement \u201c[Reserved]\u201d ( a ) [Reserved].

For guidance see \u00a7 86.1811-04 . ( g ) Cold temperature exhaust emission standards. ( 1 ) Cold temperature CO standards. These cold temperature CO standards are applicable only to gasoline fueled LDV/Ts and MDPVs. Cold temperature CO exhaust emission standards apply over a useful life of 50,000 miles or 5 years (whichever occurs first) as follows: ( i ) For LDVs and LDT1s, the standard is 10.0 grams per mile CO. ( ii ) For LDT2s, LDT3s and LDT4s, and MDPVs, the standard is 12.5 grams per mile CO. ( iii ) These standards do not apply to interim non-Tier 2 MDPVs. ( 2 ) Cold temperature NMHC standards. Full useful life fleet average cold temperature NMHC standards are applicable only to gasoline fueled LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs, and apply equally to certification and in-use except as otherwise specified in paragraph (u) of this section for in-use standards for applicable phase-in models. Testing with other fuels such as E85, or testing on diesel vehicles, is not required. Multi-fuel, bi-fuel or dual-fuel vehicles must comply with requirements using gasoline only. For LDV/LLDTs, the useful life is 120,000 miles or 10 years, whichever comes first. For HLDT/MDPVs, the useful life is 120,000 miles or 11 years, whichever comes first. There is not an intermediate useful life standard for cold temperature NMHC standards. ( i ) The standards are shown in the following table: Table S10-1\u2014Fleet Average Cold Temperature NMHC Full Useful Life Exhaust Emission Standards Vehicle weight category Cold temperature NMHC sales-weighted fleet average standard (grams/mile) LDVs & LLDTs (\u22646,000 lbs GVWR) 0.3 HLDTs (>6,000-8,500 lbs GVWR) & MDPVs (>8,500-10,000 lbs GVWR) 0.5 ( ii ) The manufacturer must calculate its fleet average cold temperature NMHC emission level(s) as described in \u00a7 86.1864-10(m) . ( iii ) During a phase-in year, the manufacturer must comply with the fleet average standards for the required phase-in percentage for that year as specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, or for the alternate phase-in percentage as permitted under paragraph (g)(4) of this section. ( iv ) For model years prior to 2010 (LDV/LLDTs) and 2012 (HLDT/MDPVs), where the manufacturer desires to bank early NMHC credits as permitted under \u00a7 86.1864-10(o)(5) , the manufacturer must achieve a fleet average standard below the applicable standard. Manufacturers must determine compliance with the cold temperature NMHC fleet average standard according to \u00a7 86.1864-10(o) . ( 3 ) Phase-in of the cold temperature NMHC standards. Except as permitted in \u00a7 86.1811-04(k)(5)(vi) and (vii) regarding small volume manufacturers, manufacturers must comply with the phase-in requirements in Tables S10-2 and S10-3. Separate phase-in schedules are provided for LDV/LLDTs and for HLDT/MDPVs. These requirements specify the minimum percentage of the manufacturer's LDV/LLDT and HLDT/MDPV 50-State sales, by model year, that must meet the fleet average cold temperature NMHC standard for their full useful lives. LDVs and LLDTs must be grouped together to determine compliance with these phase-in requirements, and HLDTs and MDPVs must also be grouped together to determine compliance with these phase-in requirements. Tables S10-2 and S10-3 follow: Table S10-2\u2014Phase-in Percentages for LDV/LLDT Cold Temperature NMHC Requirements Model year Percentage of LDV/LLDTs that must meet requirement 2010 25 2011 50 2012 75 2013 and subsequent 100 Table S10-3\u2014Phase-in Percentages for HLDT/MDPV Cold Temperature NMHC Requirements Model year Percentage of HLDT/MDPVs that must meet requirement 2012 25 2013 50 2014 75 2015 and subsequent 100 ( 4 ) Alternate phase-in schedules for cold temperature NMHC standards. ( i ) Manufacturers may apply for alternate phase-in schedules that would still result in 100% phase-in by 2013 and 2015, respectively, for LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs. An alternate phase-in schedule submitted by a manufacturer is subject to EPA approval. The alternate phase-in will not be used to delay full implementation past the last year of the primary phase-in schedule (2013 for LDV/LLDTs, 2015 for HLDT/MDPVs). An alternate phase-in schedule will be acceptable if it satisfies the following conditions (where API = Anticipated Phase-In percentage for the referenced model year): LDV/LLDTs: (6 \u00d7 API 2008 ) + (5 \u00d7 API 2009 ) + (4 \u00d7 API 2010 ) + (3 \u00d7 API 2011 ) + (2 \u00d7 API 2012 ) + (1 \u00d7 API 2013 ) \u2265 500%, and (6 \u00d7 API 2008 ) + (5 \u00d7 API 2009 ) + (4 \u00d7 API 2010 ) \u2265 100% HLDT/MDPVs: (6 \u00d7 API 2010 ) + (5 \u00d7 API 2011 ) + (4 \u00d7 API 2012 ) + (3 \u00d7 API 2013 ) + (2 \u00d7 API 2014 ) + (1 \u00d7 API 2015 ) \u2265 500%, and (6 \u00d7 API 2010 ) + (5 \u00d7 API 2011 ) + (4 \u00d7 API 2012 ) \u2265 100%, or (6 \u00d7 API 2010 ) + (5 \u00d7 API 2011 ) + (4 \u00d7 API 2012 ) + (3 \u00d7 API 2013 ) + (2 \u00d7 API 2014 ) + (1 \u00d7 API 2015 ) \u2265 600% ( ii ) ( A ) For LDV/LLDTs, if the sum of products in paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section is greater than or equal to 500%, which is the sum of products from the primary phase-in schedule (4 \u00d7 25% + 3 \u00d7 50% + 2 \u00d7 75% + 1 \u00d7 100% = 500%), then the alternate phase-in schedule is acceptable, except as prohibited in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) and (iii) of this section. In addition, manufacturers electing to use an alternate phase-in schedule for compliance with the cold temperature NMHC exhaust emission standards must ensure that the sum of products is at least 100% for model years 2010 and earlier for LDV/LLDTs. For example, a phase-in schedule for LDV/LLDTs of 5/10/10/45/80/100 that begins in 2008 would calculate as (6 \u00d7 5%) + (5 \u00d7 10%) + (4 \u00d7 10%) = 120% and would be acceptable for 2008-2010. The full phase-in would calculate as (6 \u00d7 5%) + (5 \u00d7 10%) + (4 \u00d7 10%) + (3 \u00d7 45%) + (2 \u00d7 80%) + (1 \u00d7 100%) = 515% and would be acceptable for 2008-2013. ( B ) For HLDT/MDPVs, if the sum of products in paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section is greater than or equal to 500%, which is the sum of products from the primary phase-in schedule (4 \u00d7 25% + 3 \u00d7 50% + 2 \u00d7 75% + 1 \u00d7 100% = 500%), then the alternate phase-in schedule is acceptable, except as prohibited in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) and (iii) of this section. In addition, manufacturers electing to use an alternate phase-in schedule for compliance with the cold temperature NMHC exhaust emission standards must ensure that the sum of products is at least 100% for model years 2012 and earlier for HLDT/MDPVs. Alternately, if the sum of products is greater than or equal to 600%, then the alternate phase-in schedule is acceptable, except as prohibited in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) and (iii) of this section. If the sum of products is greater than or equal to 600%, then there are no requirements on the sum of products for model years 2012 and earlier. ( iii ) Under an alternate phase-in schedule, the projected phase-in percentage is not binding for a given model year, provided the sums of the actual phase-in percentages that occur meet the appropriate total sums as required in the equations of paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, and provided that 100% actual compliance is reached for the appropriate model year, either 2013 for LDV/LLDTs or 2015 for HLDT/MDPVs. ( 5 ) Manufacturers must determine compliance with required phase-in schedules as follows: ( i ) Manufacturers must submit information showing compliance with all phase-in requirements of this section with their Part I applications as required by \u00a7 86.1844(d)(13) . ( ii ) A manufacturer electing to use any alternate phase-in schedule permitted under this section must provide in its Application for Certification for the first year in which it intends to use such a schedule, and in each succeeding year during the phase-in, the intended phase-in percentages for that model year and the remaining phase-in years along with the intended final sum of those percentages as described in paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section. This information may be included with the information required under \u00a7 86.1844-01(d)(13) . In its year end annual reports, as required under \u00a7 86.1844-01(e)(4) , the manufacturer must include sufficient information so that the Administrator can verify compliance with the alternate phase-in schedule established under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section. ( 6 ) ( i ) Sales percentages for the purpose of determining compliance with the phase-in of the cold temperature NMHC requirements must be based upon projected 50-State sales of LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs of the applicable model year by the manufacturer to the point of first sale. Such sales percentages must be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent. ( ii ) Alternatively, the manufacturer may petition the Administrator to allow actual volume produced for U.S. sales to be used in lieu of projected U.S. sales for purposes of determining compliance with the phase-in percentage requirements under this section. The manufacturer must submit its petition within 30 days of the end of the model year. For EPA to approve the use of actual volume produced for U.S. sales, the manufacturer must establish to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that actual production volume is functionally equivalent to actual sales volume of LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs sold in all 50 U.S. States.

( u ) Cold temperature NMHC exhaust emission in-use standards for applicable phase-in models. An interim full useful life in-use compliance standard is calculated by adding 0.1 g/mi to the FEL to which each test group is newly certified, and applies to that test group only for the model years shown in Tables S10-4 and S10-5. Otherwise, the in-use standard is the certification standard from paragraph (g)(2) of this section. The standards apply for purposes of in-use testing only and does not apply to certification or Selective Enforcement Auditing. Tables S10-4 and S10-5 follow: Table S10-4\u2014In-Use Standards for Applicable Phase-In LDV/LLDTs Model Year of Introduction 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Models years that the interim in-use standard is available 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2011 2012 2013 Table S10-5\u2014In-Use Standards for Applicable Phase-In HLDT/MDPVs Model Year of Introduction 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Models years that the interim in-use standard is available 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2013 2014 2015 [ 72 FR 8564 , Feb. 26, 2007] \u00a7 86.1811-17 Exhaust emission standards for light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and medium-duty passenger vehicles. ( a ) Applicability and general provisions. This section describes exhaust emission standards that apply for model year 2017 and later light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles. MDPVs are subject to all the same emission standards and certification provisions that apply to LDT4. Some of the provisions of this section also apply to heavy-duty vehicles as specified in \u00a7 86.1816 . See \u00a7 86.1818 for greenhouse gas emission standards. See \u00a7 86.1813 for evaporative and refueling emission standards. This section may apply to vehicles from model years earlier than 2017 as specified in paragraph (b)(11) of this section. ( b ) Tier 3 exhaust emission standards. Exhaust emissions may not exceed the Tier 3 exhaust emission standards, as follows: ( 1 ) Measure emissions using the chassis dynamometer procedures of 40 CFR part 1066 , as follows: ( i ) Establish appropriate load settings based on loaded vehicle weight (see \u00a7 86.1803 ). ( ii ) Use appropriate driving schedules. Measurements involve testing over multiple driving schedules. The Federal Test Procedure (FTP) is based on testing with the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS). The Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP) involves testing with the UDDS, the US06 driving schedule, and the SC03 driving schedule. See 40 CFR 1066.801 for further information on these test cycles. ( iii ) Calculate SFTP emissions as a composite of test results over the driving schedules identified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section based on the following calculation: SFTP (g/mi) = 0.35 \u00d7 FTP + 0.28 \u00d7 US06 + 0.37 \u00d7 SC03 ( A ) For test vehicles that do not have air conditioning, you may omit SC03 testing. To calculate composite SFTP emissions for such vehicles, use FTP emission results to substitute for the SC03 value in the equation. ( B ) You may also use FTP emission results to substitute for the SC03 value in the equation for the types of vehicles identified in 40 CFR 600.115 that automatically qualify for the derived 5-cycle method for determining fuel economy label values. Such vehicles remain subject to the SFTP standard when tested over the SC03 driving schedule. Other vehicles remain subject to the litmus-test provisions in 40 CFR 600.115 . ( iv ) Use E10 test fuel as required in \u00a7 86.113 , except as specified in this section. ( v ) Hydrocarbon emission standards are expressed as NMOG; however, for certain vehicles you may measure exhaust emissions based on nonmethane hydrocarbon instead of NMOG as described in 40 CFR 1066.635 . ( vi ) Measure emissions from hybrid electric vehicles (including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) as described in 40 CFR part 1066, subpart F , except that these procedures do not apply for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles during charge-depleting operation. ( 2 ) Table 1 of this section describes fully phased-in Tier 3 standards that apply as specified in this paragraph (b) for the identified driving schedules. The FTP standards for NMOG + NO X apply on a fleet-average basis using discrete bin standards as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The bin standards include additional emission standards for high-altitude testing and for CO emissions when testing over the FTP driving schedule. The SFTP standards for NMOG + NO X apply on a fleet-average basis as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Table 1 follows: Table 1 of \u00a7 86.1811-17 \u2014Fully Phased-in Tier 3 Exhaust Emission Standards ( g/mile ) NMOG + NO X PM CO Formaldehyde FTP 1 SFTP FTP US06 SFTP FTP 0.030 0.050 0.003 0.006 4.2 0.004 1 The fleet-average FTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X is 0.026 g/mile for LDV and LDT1 test groups certified to standards based on a useful life of 120,000 miles or 10 years in a given model year. ( 3 ) The FTP standards specified in this section apply for testing at low-altitude conditions and high-altitude conditions as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The SFTP standards specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section apply only for testing at low-altitude conditions. ( 4 ) The FTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X is based on a fleet average for a given model year. You must specify a family emission limit (FEL) for each test group. The FEL serves as the emission standard for the test group with respect to all required FTP testing. Calculate your fleet-average emission level as described in \u00a7 86.1860 based on the FEL that applies for low-altitude testing to show that you meet the specified standard. For multi-fueled vehicles, calculate fleet-average emission levels based only on emission levels for testing with gasoline or diesel fuel. You may generate emission credits for banking and trading and you may use banked or traded credits as described in \u00a7 86.1861 for demonstrating compliance with the FTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X . You comply with the emission standard for a given model year if you have enough credits to show that your fleet-average emission level is at or below the applicable standard. You may exchange FTP credits between or among any test groups subject to standards under this section. You may not exchange FTP and SFTP credits. ( i ) Specify one of the identified values from Table 2 of this section as the FEL for demonstrating that your fleet-average emission level complies with the FTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X under low-altitude conditions. These FEL values define emission bins that also determine corresponding emission standards for NMOG + NO X emissions under high-altitude conditions, and for CO emissions, as follows: Table 2 of \u00a7 86.1811-17 \u2014Tier 3 FTP Bin Standards [g/mile] FEL Name NMOG + NO X FELs for low altitude NMOG + NO X for high altitude CO for low and high altitude Bin 160 0.160 0.160 4.2 Bin 125 0.125 0.160 2.1 Bin 70 0.070 0.105 1.7 Bin 50 0.050 0.070 1.7 Bin 30 0.030 0.050 1.0 Bin 20 0.020 0.030 1.0 Bin 0 0.000 0.000 0.0 ( ii ) Manufacturers earn a compliance credit of 0.005 g/mile NMOG + NO X for vehicles that are certified for a useful life of 150,000 miles or 15 years and that are covered by an extended warranty over the same period for all components whose failure triggers MIL illumination. Manufacturers may apply the compliance credit as follows: ( A ) You may reduce your official FTP emission result for certification by the amount of the compliance credit if that allows you to certify to a more stringent bin. In that case, you may use the more stringent bin standard for calculating the fleet-average NMOG + NO X emission level. For any compliance testing with these vehicles, the applicable FTP bin standard for NMOG + NO X is higher than the specified bin standard by the amount of the compliance credit. For example, if the official FTP emission result for NMOG + NO X is 0.052 g/mile, this qualifies for an FEL of 0.050 g/mile for calculating the fleet average and the vehicle is subject to an FTP bin standard of 0.055 g/mile. ( B ) If the amount of the compliance credit does not allow you to certify to a more stringent bin, calculate the fleet-average NMOG + NO X emission level using an FEL for these vehicles that is smaller than the bin standard by the amount of the compliance credit. For any compliance testing with these vehicles, the specified bin standard applies. For example, if the official FTP emission result for NMOG + NO X is 0.038 g/mile, calculate the fleet-average NMOG + NO X emission level by specifying an FEL of 0.045 g/mile; these vehicles are subject to the specified FTP bin standard of 0.050 g/mile. ( iii ) If you qualify for a compliance credit for direct ozone reduction under the LEV III program, you may apply the compliance credit approved for California vehicles as described in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section. ( iv ) You may combine the adjustments in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section if you qualify for them separately. ( 5 ) The SFTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X is also based on a fleet average in a given model year. You must specify FELs as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section and calculate a fleet-average emission level to show that you meet the SFTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X , except that you may specify FELs in any even increment of 0.010 g/mile up to a maximum value of 0.180 g/mile. You may generate emission credits for banking and trading and you may use banked or traded credits as described in \u00a7 86.1861 for demonstrating compliance with the SFTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X . You comply with the emission standard for a given model year if you have enough credits to show that your fleet-average emission level is at or below the applicable standard. You may exchange SFTP credits between or among any test groups subject to standards under this section. You may not exchange FTP and SFTP credits. The SFTP standards described in this section apply only for testing at low-altitude conditions. ( 6 ) The full Tier 3 program includes new emission standards for NMOG + NO X , PM, CO, and formaldehyde; it also includes measurement with a new test fuel and a longer useful life (for some vehicles). Vehicles meeting all these requirements are considered Final Tier 3 vehicles. Vehicles that do not meet all the Tier 3 requirements are considered Interim Tier 3 vehicles. Paragraphs (b)(7) through (13) of this section describe how to comply with standards during a phase-in period. ( 7 ) The Tier 3 PM standards phase in over several years. The following provisions describe the primary approach for phasing in the Tier 3 PM standards: ( i ) You must meet the FTP and the US06 PM standards with 20, 20, 40, 70, and 100 percent of your projected nationwide sales of all vehicles subject to this section in model years 2017 through 2021, respectively. In model years 2017 and 2018, an interim US06 PM standard of 0.010 g/mile applies. Each vehicle meeting the Tier 3 FTP standard for PM must also meet the Tier 3 US06 standard for PM. In model year 2017, the phase-in requirement applies only for vehicles at or below 6,000 pounds GVWR; however, you may meet an alternative phase-in requirement of 10 percent in model year 2017 based on your full production of vehicles subject to standards under this section. ( ii ) You may disregard the phase-in percentages specified in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section if you instead comply with an indexed PM phase-in schedule as described in this paragraph (b)(7)(ii) . To do this, you must notify us of your intent before January 1, 2017, and include a detailed plan for complying with the indexed phase-in schedule. You comply with the indexed phase-in schedule by calculating a PM phase-in index at or above 540 using the following equation for model years 2017 through 2021: PM phase-in index = 5 \u00b7 APP 2017 + 4 \u00b7 APP 2018 + 3 \u00b7 APP 2019 + 2 \u00b7 APP 2020 + APP 2021 Where: APP = The phase-in percentage of vehicles meeting the Tier 3 PM standards for the indicated model year, based on actual sales, as described in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section. ( iii ) Vehicles meeting the Tier 3 PM standards must meet those standards over the useful life as specified in \u00a7 86.1805 . Note that Interim Tier 3 vehicles may have different useful life values for PM emission standards than for other emission standards. ( iv ) Any vehicles not included for demonstrating compliance with the Tier 3 PM phase-in requirement must instead comply with an FTP emission standard for PM of 0.010 g/mile, and a composite SFTP emission standard for PM of 0.070 g/mile. ( v ) Measure PM emissions from all vehicles using the same test fuel specified in paragraph (b)(8) of this section for measuring NMOG + NO X emissions. ( vi ) You may certify Interim Tier 3 vehicles based on carryover data. ( vii ) You may use the alternative phase-in provisions described in paragraph (b)(9) of this section to transition to the Tier 3 exhaust emission standards on a different schedule. ( 8 ) The following provisions describe the primary approach for phasing in the Tier 3 standards other than PM in 2025 and earlier model years: ( i ) FTP phase-in. The fleet-average FTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X phases in over several years as described in this paragraph (b)(8)(i) . You must identify FELs as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section and calculate a fleet-average emission level to show that you meet the FTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X that applies for each model year. For model year 2017, do not include vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR. Through model year 2019, you may also certify to transitional Bin 85 or Bin 110 standards, which consist of all-altitude FTP emission standards for NMOG + NO X of 0.085 or 0.110 g/mile, respectively; additional FTP standards for PM, CO, and formaldehyde apply as specified in this section for vehicles certified to Bin 125 standards. Fleet-average FTP emission standards decrease through the phase-in period as shown in the following table: Table 3 of \u00a7 86.1811-17 \u2014Declining Fleet-Average Tier 3 FTP Emission Standards for NMOG + NO X ( g/mile ) Model year LDV, LDT1\u2014150,000 mile useful life 1 LDV, LDT1\u2014120,000 mile useful life 1 LDT2, HLDT 2017 2 0.086 0.073 0.101 2018 0.079 0.067 0.092 2019 0.072 0.061 0.083 2020 0.065 0.055 0.074 2021 0.058 0.049 0.065 2022 0.051 0.043 0.056 2023 0.044 0.037 0.047 2024 0.037 0.031 0.038 2025 0.030 0.026 0.030 1 Vehicles certified to standards based on a useful life of 120,000 miles may comply based on the fleet-average standard specified for 150,000 mile useful life in certain circumstances as specified in paragraph (b)(8)(iii)(A) of this section. 2 HLDT and MDPV must meet the Tier 3 standards starting with model year 2018. ( ii ) SFTP phase-in. The fleet-average SFTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X phases in over several years as described in this paragraph (b)(8)(ii) . You must identify FELs as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section and calculate a fleet-average emission level to show that you meet the SFTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X that applies for each model year. ( A ) Calculate the fleet-average emission level together for all your light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, except for those certified using the provisions of paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(C) of this section. For model year 2017, do not include vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR (in the numerator or denominator). ( B ) Fleet-average SFTP emission standards decrease through the phase-in period as shown in the following table: Table 4 of \u00a7 86.1811-17 \u2014Declining Fleet-Average Tier 3 SFTP Emission Standards Model year NMOG + NO X (g/mile) 2017 1 0.103 2018 0.097 2019 0.090 2020 0.083 2021 0.077 2022 0.070 2023 0.063 2024 0.057 2025 0.050 1 HLDT and MDPV must meet the Tier 3 standards starting with model year 2018. ( C ) You may use the SFTP stand-alone option specified in 13 CCR 1961.2 (a)(7)(A)1 of the LEV III program to demonstrate compliance with EPA's SFTP standards. Do not include any such test groups when demonstrating compliance with the phased-in fleet-average SFTP standards specified in this paragraph (b)(8)(ii) . Note that this option is not available for vehicles certified to the transitional bins described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section. ( iii ) Interim provisions. ( A ) For vehicles certified to bins higher than Bin 70 under this section through model year 2019, the Tier 2 useful life period applies as specified in \u00a7 86.1805-12 for all criteria pollutants other than PM. However, LDV and LDT1 test groups certified to bin standards above Bin 70 through model year 2019 may be included in the same averaging set with vehicles meeting standards over a 150,000 mile useful life, notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 86.1861-17(b)(1)(iii) . Any such vehicles you include in the averaging set for 150,000 mile useful life are also subject to the fleet-average NMOG + NO X standard specified for 150,000 mile useful life; similarly, any such vehicles you include in the averaging set for 120,000 mile useful life are also subject to the fleet-average NMOG + NO X standard specified for 120,000 mile useful life. ( B ) You may continue to use the E0 test fuel specified in \u00a7 86.113 as described in 40 CFR 600.117 . ( C ) Vehicles must comply with the Tier 2 SFTP emission standards for NMHC + NO X and CO for 4,000-mile testing that are specified in \u00a7 86.1811-04(f)(1) if they are certified to transitional Bin 85 or Bin 110 standards, or if they are certified based on a fuel without ethanol, or if they are not certified to the Tier 3 p.m. standard. Note that the standards in this paragraph (b)(8)(iii)(C) apply under this section for alternative fueled vehicles, for flexible fueled vehicles when operated on a fuel other than gasoline or diesel fuel, and for MDPVs, even though these vehicles were not subject to the SFTP standards in the Tier 2 program. ( iv ) You may use the alternative phase-in provisions described in paragraph (b)(9) of this section to transition to the Tier 3 exhaust emission standards on a different schedule. ( 9 ) This paragraph (b)(9) describes an alternative approach to phasing in the Tier 3 emission standards for vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR. If you choose this approach, you must phase in the Tier 3 standards for all your vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR that are subject to this section according to this schedule. Under this alternative phase-in, you must meet the fully phased-in standards specified in this paragraph (b) with 40, 70, and 100 percent of your projected nationwide sales of all vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR that are subject to this section in model years 2019 through 2021, respectively. Any vehicles not subject to Tier 3 standards during the phase-in period must continue to comply with the Tier 2 standards in \u00a7 86.1811-04(c) and (f) , including the Tier 2 SFTP emission standards for NMHC + NO X and CO for 4,000-mile testing as specified in \u00a7 86.1811-04(f)(1) . Vehicles subject to Tier 2 standards under this paragraph (b)(9) are subject to the useful life provisions in \u00a7 86.1805-12 relative to exhaust emission standards. Each vehicle counting toward the phase-in percentage under this paragraph (b)(9) must meet all the standards that apply throughout the useful life as specified in \u00a7 86.1805-17 , and must use the Tier 3 test fuel specified in \u00a7 86.113-15 . The following exceptions and special provisions apply under this paragraph (b)(9) : ( i ) For model year 2019, you may exclude from the phase-in calculation any test groups with vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR that have a Job 1 date on or before March 3, 2018 (see 40 CFR 85.2304 ). ( ii ) The FTP and SFTP emission standards for NMOG + NO X are fleet-average standards. Calculate your fleet-average values based on all the vehicles that are subject to the standard in a given year. You may not generate credits for banking or trading in model years 2019 or 2020, and you may not use banked or traded credits to demonstrate compliance with the standards in those years. ( iii ) The US06 emission standard for PM is 0.010 g/mile in model years 2019 through 2021, and 0.006 g/mile starting in model year 2022. The other standards described in this paragraph (b)(9) apply to all your vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR in model years 2022 through 2024. ( 10 ) You may not use credits generated from Tier 2 vehicles for demonstrating compliance with the Tier 3 standards except as specified in this paragraph (b)(10) . You may generate early credits with U.S. sales of Tier 2 vehicles in the two model years before the Tier 3 standards start to apply for a given vehicle model. Vehicles certified to the Tier 2 standards must meet all the Tier 2 requirements in \u00a7 86.1811-10 , including the fleet-average Tier 2 standards. Calculate early Tier 3 emission credits as described in \u00a7 86.1861 by subtracting the appropriate Tier 2 fleet-average value for FTP emissions of NMOG + NO X from 0.160 g/mile. Calculate your fleet-average value for the model year based on vehicles at or below 6,000 pounds GVWR in 2015, on all sizes of vehicles in 2016, and on vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR in 2017. You may use these early credits as described in \u00a7 86.1861 for demonstrating compliance with the FTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X starting in model year 2017. You may use these early credits interchangeably for vehicles certified based on a useful life of either 120,000 or 150,000 miles. For model years 2018 and later, you may use any remaining early credits for banking or trading subject to a limitation based on credits generated in California, as follows: ( i ) For the applicable model years in which you generate emission credits relative to California's LEV III fleet-average NMOG + NO X standard, determine the actual California sales of light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks and the actual nationwide sales of those same vehicles. (Note: If you have a credit deficit in a given model year for your LEV III vehicles, apply the provisions of this paragraph (b)(10)(i) based on the appropriate negative credit quantity.) In 2015, count sales only from vehicle models at or below 6,000 pounds GVWR. For each model year, multiply the credits generated under the California program by the ratio of nationwide vehicle sales to LEV III vehicle sales to calculate an effective nationwide quantity. Sum these results for model years 2015 through 2017. Note that this calculation results in a maximum credit quantity based on vehicle sales in all states, even though the initial credit calculation does not include vehicle sales in California or the section 177 states. If you comply with the LEV III standards based on pooled emission credits for California and the section 177 states, use those pooled emission credits and corresponding sales for calculating the maximum credit quantity under this paragraph (b)(10)(i) . ( ii ) You may not use more early credits generated under this paragraph (b)(10) for banking or trading to demonstrate compliance with Tier 3 emission standards than the calculated value of the effective nationwide credit quantity summed in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section. If your generated credits are greater than this threshold, determine the ratio by which your generated early credits exceed the threshold. Calculate an adjusted quantity of early credits generated under this paragraph (b)(10) by dividing the generated credit quantity from each model year by this ratio of generated credits relative to the applicable threshold. This adjusted quantity of credits may be used for banking or trading relative to the Tier 3 standards, subject to the five-year credit life described in \u00a7 86.1861 . ( 11 ) You may certify vehicles to the Tier 3 standards starting in model year 2015. To do this, you may either sell all your LEV III vehicle models nationwide, or you may certify a subset of your fleet to alternate fleet-average emission standards as follows: ( i ) The alternate fleet-average FTP emission standards for NMOG + NO X are 0.100 g/mile in 2015 and 0.093 g/mile in 2016 for LDV and LDT1. ( ii ) The alternate fleet-average FTP emission standards for NMOG + NO X are 0.119 g/mile in 2015, 0.110 g/mile in 2016, and 0.101 g/mile in 2017 for LDT2 and HLDT. ( iii ) The alternate fleet-average SFTP emission standards for NMOG + NO X are 0.140 in 2015 for all vehicles, 0.110 in 2016 for all vehicles, and 0.103 in 2017 for LDT2 and HLDT. ( iv ) The vehicles must meet FTP and SFTP standards for PM as specified in \u00a7 86.1811-04 . The PM testing provisions of \u00a7 86.1829-01(b)(1)(iii)(B) apply for these vehicles. ( v ) Vehicles not certified to the Tier 3 standards in a given model year must meet all the requirements that apply for Tier 2 vehicles in that model year. ( vi ) For cold temperature testing and for high-altitude testing, you may use the E0 fuel specified in \u00a7 86.113-04(a) or \u00a7 86.213 instead of the E10 test fuel specified in \u00a7 86.113-15 . ( vii ) Vehicles certified under this paragraph (b)(11) to a bin standard at or below Bin 70 must be certified to a useful life of 150,000 miles. ( viii ) The interim provisions described in paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of this section apply for vehicles certified under this paragraph (b)(11) , except that credits generated under this paragraph (b)(11) may be used interchangeably for vehicles certified based on a useful life of either 120,000 or 150,000 miles. ( ix ) For vehicles certified under this paragraph (b)(11) , you may generate emission credits and use those credits for demonstrating compliance with Tier 3 standards as described in paragraph (b)(10) of this section or as described in \u00a7 86.1861 . ( 12 ) The following alternate standards apply for in-use testing: ( i ) Alternate in-use FTP standards for NMOG + NO X apply for 2021 and earlier model year vehicles certified to Bin 70 and lower. Calculate these alternate standards by multiplying the applicable FEL by 1.4. These alternate standards apply only for testing at low-altitude conditions. ( ii ) The alternate in-use FTP standard for PM is 0.006 g/mile for 2021 and earlier model year vehicles. ( iii ) The in-use US06 standard for PM is 0.010 g/mile for 2023 and earlier model year vehicles. ( 13 ) Keep records as needed to show that you meet the requirements specified in this paragraph (b) for phasing in standards and for complying with declining fleet-average average standards. ( 14 ) This subpart describes several ways that the transition to Final Tier 3 standards applies differently for vehicles above and below 6,000 pounds GVWR. All these distinctions apply only for LDT. LDV as a category is defined independent of GVWR, so any LDV above 6,000 pounds GVWR are subject to the same provisions that apply for LDV at or below 6,000 pounds GVWR. Where this section refers to \u201cvehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR,\u201d this should be understood to include LDT above 6,000 pounds GVWR and MDPV (or HLDT and MDPV), and to exclude all LDV. ( c ) Highway NMOG + NO X exhaust emission standard. NMOG + NO X emissions measured on the federal Highway Fuel Economy Test in 40 CFR 1066.840 may not exceed the applicable FTP bin standard for NMOG + NO X . Demonstrate compliance with this standard for low-mileage vehicles by applying the appropriate deterioration factor. For vehicles not certified to any Tier 3 emission standards specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the provisions of \u00a7 86.1811-04(j) apply instead of this paragraph (c) . ( d ) Special provisions for Otto-cycle engines. The following special provisions apply for vehicles with Otto-cycle engines: ( 1 ) Enrichment limits. The nominal air-fuel ratio throughout the US06 cycle may not be richer than the leanest air-fuel mixture required for lean best torque, except as allowed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Unless we approve otherwise in advance, lean best torque is the leanest air-fuel ratio required at any speed and load point with a fixed spark advance to make peak torque. The allowable tolerance around the nominal value for any given speed and load point over the US06 cycle for a particular vehicle is 4 percent, which is calculated as the nominal mass-based air-fuel ratio for lean best torque divided by 1.04. ( 2 ) Engine protection. AECDs that use commanded enrichment to protect the engine or emission control hardware must not use enrichment more frequently or to a greater degree than is needed for this purpose. For purposes of this section, commanded enrichment includes intended engine operation at air-fuel ratios rich of stoichiometry, except the following: ( i ) Cycling back and forth in a narrow window between rich and lean operation as a result of feedback controls targeted to maintain overall engine operation at stoichiometry. ( ii ) Small changes in the target air-fuel ratio to optimize vehicle emissions or drivability. This may be called \u201cclosed-loop biasing.\u201d ( iii ) Temporary enrichment in response to rapid throttle motion. ( iv ) Enrichment during cold-start and warm-up conditions. ( v ) Temporary enrichment for running OBD checks to comply with \u00a7 86.1806 . ( 3 ) A/C-on specific calibrations. ( i ) A/C-on specific calibrations (e.g., air-fuel ratio, spark timing, and exhaust gas recirculation) that differ from A/C-off calibrations may be used for a given set of engine operating conditions (e.g., engine speed, manifold pressure, coolant temperature, air charge temperature, and any other parameters). Such calibrations must not unnecessarily reduce emission control effectiveness during A/C-on operation when the vehicle is operated under conditions that may reasonably be expected during normal operation and use. If emission control effectiveness decreases as a result of such calibrations, the manufacturer must describe in the Application for Certification the circumstances under which this occurs and the reason for using these calibrations. ( ii ) For AECDs involving commanded enrichment, these AECDs must not operate differently for A/C-on operation than for A/C-off operation, except as provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. This includes both the sensor inputs for triggering enrichment and the degree of enrichment employed. ( 4 ) \u201c Lean-on-cruise\u201d calibration strategies. Manufacturers may use \u201clean-on-cruise\u201d strategies subject to the following specifications: ( i ) A \u201clean-on-cruise\u201d strategy is defined as the use of an air-fuel ratio significantly leaner than stoichiometry during non-deceleration conditions at speeds above 40 mph. ( ii ) You must not employ \u201clean-on-cruise\u201d strategies during vehicle operation in normal driving conditions, including A/C usage, unless at least one of the following conditions is met: ( A ) Such strategies are substantially employed during the FTP, US06, or SC03 duty cycle. ( B ) Such strategies are demonstrated not to significantly reduce vehicle emission control effectiveness over the operating conditions in which they are employed. ( C ) Such strategies are demonstrated to be necessary to protect the vehicle occupants, engine, or emission control hardware. ( iii ) If you propose to use a \u201clean-on-cruise\u201d strategy, you must describe in the application for certification the circumstances under which such a calibration would be used and the reasons for using it. ( e ) through ( f ) [Reserved] ( g ) Cold temperature exhaust emission standards. The standards in this paragraph (g) apply for certification and in-use vehicles tested over the test procedures specified in subpart C of this part . These standards apply only to gasoline-fueled vehicles. Multi-fuel, bi-fuel or dual-fuel vehicles must comply with requirements using gasoline only. Testing with other fuels such as a high-level ethanol-gasoline blend, or testing on diesel vehicles, is not required. ( 1 ) Cold temperature CO standards. Cold temperature CO exhaust emission standards apply for testing at both low-altitude conditions and high-altitude conditions as follows: ( i ) For LDV and LDT1, the standard is 10.0 g/mile CO. ( ii ) For LDT2, LDT3 and LDT4, the standard is 12.5 grams per mile CO. ( 2 ) Cold temperature NMHC standards. The following fleet average cold temperature NMHC standards apply as follows: ( i ) The standards are shown in the following table: Table 5 of \u00a7 86.1811-17 \u2014Fleet Average Cold Temperature NMHC Exhaust Emission Standards Vehicle weight category Cold temperature NMHC sales- weighted fleet average standard (g/mile) LDV and LLDT 0.3 HLDT 0.5 ( ii ) The manufacturer must calculate its fleet average cold temperature NMHC emission level(s) as described in \u00a7 86.1864-10(b) . ( iii ) The standards specified in this paragraph (g)(2) apply only for testing at low-altitude conditions. However, manufacturers must submit an engineering evaluation indicating that common calibration approaches are utilized at high altitudes. Any deviation from low altitude emission control practices must be included in the auxiliary emission control device (AECD) descriptions submitted at certification. Any AECD specific to high altitude must require engineering emission data for EPA evaluation to quantify any emission impact and validity of the AECD. ( h ) Small-volume manufacturers. Small-volume manufacturers may use the following Tier 3 phase-in provisions: ( 1 ) Instead of the fleet-average FTP standards for NMOG + NO X specified in this section, small-volume manufacturers may meet alternate fleet-average standards of 0.125 g/mile through model year 2021, and 0.051 g/mile for model years 2022 through 2027. The following additional provisions apply for vehicles certified under this paragraph (h)(1) : ( i ) Vehicles are subject to exhaust emission standards over the useful life as specified in \u00a7 86.1805-12 through model year 2021, and as specified in this section starting in model year 2022. ( ii ) Gasoline-fueled vehicles may use the E0 test fuel specified in \u00a7 86.113-04 for vehicles certified to bins higher than Bin 70 through model year 2021. ( iii ) Vehicles certified under this paragraph (h)(1) may generate emission credits and they may use banked or traded emission credits relative to the alternate fleet-average FTP standard for NMOG + NO X only in model years 2022 through 2027. ( iv ) Vehicles are subject to all the other requirements specified in this section. ( 2 ) Small-volume manufacturers may delay complying with all the requirements of this section until model year 2022, and instead meet all the requirements that apply to Tier 2 vehicles under \u00a7 86.1811-10 for 2021 and earlier model years. ( 3 ) If meeting the Tier 3 standards would cause severe economic hardship, small-volume manufacturers may ask us to approve an extended compliance deadline under the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.250 , except that the solvency criterion does not apply and there is no maximum duration of the hardship relief. [ 79 FR 23713 , Apr. 28, 2014, as amended at 80 FR 9105 , Feb. 19, 2015; 81 FR 73984 , Oct. 25, 2016; 86 FR 34371 , June 29, 2021; 89 FR 28162 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1811-27 Criteria exhaust emission standards. ( a ) Applicability and general provisions. The criteria exhaust emission standards of this section apply for both light-duty program vehicles and medium-duty vehicles, starting with model year 2027. ( 1 ) A vehicle meeting all the requirements of this section is considered a Tier 4 vehicle meeting the Tier 4 standards. Vehicles meeting some but not all requirements are considered interim Tier 4 vehicles as described in paragraph (b)(6)(iv) of this section. ( 2 ) The Tier 4 standards include testing over a range of driving schedules and ambient temperatures. The standards for 25 \u00b0C or 35 \u00b0C testing in paragraph (b) of this section apply separate from the \u22127 \u00b0C testing in paragraph (c) of this section. We may identify these standards based on nominal ambient test temperatures. Note that \u22127 \u00b0C testing is also identified as cold temperature testing elsewhere in this subpart. ( 3 ) See \u00a7 86.1813 for evaporative and refueling emission standards. ( 4 ) See \u00a7 86.1818 for greenhouse gas emission standards. ( b ) Exhaust emission standards for 25 and 35 \u00b0C testing. Exhaust emissions may not exceed standards over several driving cycles as follows: ( 1 ) Measure emissions using the chassis dynamometer procedures of 40 CFR part 1066 , as follows: ( i ) Establish appropriate load settings based on loaded vehicle weight for light-duty program vehicles and adjusted loaded vehicle weight for medium-duty vehicles (see \u00a7 86.1803 ). ( ii ) Emission standards under this paragraph (b) apply for all the following driving cycles unless otherwise specified: The driving cycle . . . is identified in . . . (A) FTP 40 CFR 1066.801(c)(1) . (B) US06 40 CFR 1066.801(c)(2) . (C) SC03 40 CFR 1066.801(c)(3) . (D) HFET 40 CFR 1066.801(c)(5) . (E) ACC II\u2014Mid-temperature intermediate soak 40 CFR 1066.801(c)(8) . (F) ACC II\u2014Early driveaway 40 CFR 1066.801(c)(9) . (G) ACC II High-load PHEV engine starts 40 CFR 1066.801(c)(10) . ( iii ) Testing occurs at (20-30) \u00b0C ambient temperatures, except that a nominal ambient temperature of 35.0 \u00b0C applies for testing over the SC03 driving cycle. See paragraph (c) of this section for emission standards and measurement procedures that apply for cold temperature testing. ( iv ) Hydrocarbon emission standards are expressed as NMOG; however, for certain vehicles you may measure exhaust emissions based on nonmethane hydrocarbon instead of NMOG as described in 40 CFR 1066.635 . ( v ) Measure emissions from hybrid electric vehicles (including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) as described in 40 CFR part 1066, subpart F , except that these procedures do not apply for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles during charge-depleting operation. ( 2 ) Fully phased-in standards apply as specified in the following table: Table 1\u2014To Paragraph (b) (2)\u2014Fully Phased-In Tier 4 Criteria Exhaust Emission Standards a NMOG+NO X (mg/mile) b PM (mg/mile) c CO (g/mile) d Formaldehyde (mg/mile) e Light-duty program vehicles 15 0.5 1.7 4 Medium-duty vehicles 75 0.5 3.2 6 a Paragraphs (b)(6) and (f) of this section describe how these standards phase in for model year 2027 and later vehicles. b The NMOG+NO X standards apply on a fleet-average basis using discrete bin standards as described in paragraphs (b)(4) and (6) of this section. c PM standards do not apply for the SC03, HFET, and ACC II driving cycles specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(C) through (G) of this section. d Alternative CO standards of 9.6 and 25 g/mile apply for the US06 driving cycle for light-duty program vehicles and medium-duty vehicles, respectively. CO standards do not apply for the ACC II driving cycles specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(E) through (G) of this section. e Formaldehyde standards apply only for the FTP driving cycle. ( 3 ) The FTP standards specified in this paragraph (b) apply equally for testing at low-altitude conditions and high-altitude conditions. The US06, SC03, and HFET standards apply only for testing at low-altitude conditions. ( 4 ) The NMOG+NO X emission standard is based on a fleet average for a given model year. ( i ) You must specify a family emission limit (FEL) for each test group based on the FTP emission standard corresponding to each named bin. The FEL serves as the emission standard for the test group with respect to all specified driving cycles. Calculate your fleet average emission level as described in \u00a7 86.1860 to show that you meet the specified fleet average standard. For multi-fueled vehicles, calculate fleet average emission levels based only on emission levels for testing with gasoline or diesel fuel. You may generate emission credits for banking and trading, and you may use banked or traded credits as described in \u00a7 86.1861 for demonstrating compliance with the fleet average NMOG+NO X emission standard. You comply with the fleet average emission standard for a given model year if you have enough credits to show that your fleet average emission level is at or below the applicable standard. ( ii ) Select one of the identified values from table 2 of this section for demonstrating that your fleet average emission level for light-duty program vehicles complies with the fleet average NMOG+NO X emission standard. These FEL values define emission bins that also determine corresponding emission standards for NMOG+NO X emission standards for ACC II driving cycles, as follows: Table 2 to Paragraph (b)(4)(ii) \u2014Tier 4 NMOG+NO X Bin Standards for Light-Duty Program Vehicles [mg/mile] FEL name FTP, US06, SC03, HFET ACC II\u2014Mid- temperature intermediate soak (3-12 hours) ACC II\u2014Mid- temperature intermediate soak (40 minutes) a ACC II\u2014Mid- temperature intermediate soak (10 minutes) ACC II\u2014 Early driveaway b ACC II\u2014 High-power PHEV engine starts b c Bin 70 70 70 54 35 82 200 Bin 65 65 65 50 33 77 188 Bin 60 60 60 46 30 72 175 Bin 55 55 55 42 28 67 163 Bin 50 50 50 38 25 62 150 Bin 45 45 45 35 23 57 138 Bin 40 40 40 31 20 52 125 Bin 35 35 35 27 18 47 113 Bin 30 30 30 23 15 42 100 Bin 25 25 25 19 13 37 84 Bin 20 20 20 15 10 32 67 Bin 15 15 15 12 8 27 51 Bin 10 10 10 8 5 22 34 Bin 5 5 5 4 3 17 17 Bin 0 0 a Calculate the bin standard for a soak time between 10 and 40 minutes based on a linear interpolation between the corresponding bin values for a 10-minute soak and a 40-minute soak. Similarly, calculate the bin standard for a soak time between 40 minutes and 3 hours based on a linear interpolation between the corresponding bin values for a 40-minute soak and a 3-hour soak. b Qualifying vehicles are exempt from standards for early driveaway and high-power PHEV engine starts as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. c Alternative standards apply for high-power PHEV engine starts for model years 2027 through 2029 as described in paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section. ( iii ) You may select one of the identified values from table 2 to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section for demonstrating that your fleet average emission level for medium-duty vehicles complies with the fleet average NMOG+NO X emission standard. The following additional NMOG+NO X bin standards are also available for medium-duty vehicles: 75, 85, 100, 125, 150, and 170 mg/mile. Medium-duty vehicles are not subject to standards based on the ACC II driving cycles specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(E) through (G) of this section. ( 5 ) Qualifying vehicles are exempt from certain ACC II bin standards as follows: ( i ) Vehicles are exempt from the ACC II bin standards for early driveaway if the vehicle prevents engine starting during the first 20 seconds of a cold-start FTP test interval and the vehicle does not use an electrically heated catalyst or other technology to precondition the engine or emission controls such that NMOG+NO X emissions would be higher during the first 505 seconds of the early driveaway driving cycle compared to the first 505 seconds of the conventional FTP driving cycle. ( ii ) Vehicles are exempt from the ACC II bin standards for high-power PHEV engine starts if their all-electric range on the cold-start US06 driving cycles is at or above 10 miles for model years 2027 through 2029, and at or above 40 miles for model year 2030 and later. ( 6 ) The Tier 4 standards phase in over several years, as follows: ( i ) Light-duty program vehicles. Include all light-duty program vehicles at or below 6,000 pounds GVWR in the calculation to comply with the Tier 4 fleet average NMOG+NO X standard for 25 \u00b0C testing in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. You must meet all the other Tier 4 requirements with 20, 40, 60, and 100 percent of your projected nationwide production volumes in model years 2027 through 2030, respectively. A vehicle counts toward meeting the phase-in percentage only if it meets all the requirements of this section. Fleet average NMOG+NO X standards apply as follows for model year 2027 through 2032 light-duty program vehicles: Table 3 to Paragraph (b)(6)(i) \u2014Declining Fleet Average NMOG+NO X Standards for Light-Duty Program Vehicles Model year Fleet average NMOG+NO X standard (mg/mile) 2027 25 2028 23 2029 21 2030 19 2031 17 2032 15 ( ii ) Default phase-in for vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR. The default approach for phasing in the Tier 4 standards for vehicle above 6,000 pounds GVWR is for all those vehicles to meet the fully phased in Tier 4 standards of this section starting in model year 2030 for light-duty program vehicles and in model year 2031 for medium-duty vehicles. Manufacturers using this default phase-in for medium-duty vehicles may not use credits generated from earlier model years for demonstrating compliance with the Tier 4 NMOG+NO X standards under this paragraph (b) . ( iii ) Alternative early phase-in for vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR. Manufacturers may use the following alternative early phase-in provisions to transition to the Tier 4 exhaust emission standards on an earlier schedule for vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR. ( A ) If you select the alternative early phase-in for light-duty program vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR, you must demonstrate that you meet the phase-in requirements in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section based on all your light-duty program vehicles. ( B ) If you select the alternative early phase-in for medium-duty vehicles, include all medium-duty vehicles in the calculation to comply with the Tier 4 fleet average NMOG+NO X standard starting in model year 2027. You must meet all the other Tier 4 requirements with 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 percent of a manufacturer's projected nationwide production volumes in model years 2027 through 2031, respectively. A vehicle counts toward meeting the phase-in percentage only if it meets all the requirements of this section. Medium-duty vehicles complying with the alternative early phase-in are subject to the following fleet average NMOG+NO X standards for model years 2027 through 2033: Table 4 to Paragraph (b)(6)(iii) (B)\u2014Declining Fleet Average NMOG+NO X Standards for Medium-Duty Vehicles Model year Fleet average NMOG+NO X standard (mg/mile) 2027 175 2028 160 2029 140 2030 120 2031 100 2032 80 2033 75 ( C ) If you select the alternative early phase-in but are unable to meet all the requirements that apply in any model year before model year 2030 for light-duty program vehicles and model year 2031 for medium-duty vehicles, you may switch to the default phase-in. Switching to the default phase-in does not affect certification or compliance obligations for model years before you switch to the default phase-in. ( iv ) Interim Tier 4 vehicles. Vehicles not meeting all the requirements of this section during the phase-in are considered \u201cinterim Tier 4 vehicles\u201d. Interim Tier 4 vehicles are subject to all the requirements of this subpart that apply for Tier 3 vehicles except for the fleet average NMOG+NO X standards in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811-17 and 86.1816-18 . Interim Tier 4 vehicles may certify to the 25 \u00b0C fleet average NMOG+NO X standard under this section using all available Tier 3 bins under \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811-17 and 86.1816-18 . Interim Tier 4 vehicles are subject to the whole collection of Tier 3 bin standards, and they are not subject to any of the Tier 4 bin standards specified in this section. Note that manufacturers complying with the default phase-in specified in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section for Interim Tier 4 light-duty program vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR will need to meet a Tier 3 fleet average NMOG+NO X standard in model years 2027 through 2029 in addition to the Tier 4 fleet average NMOG+NO X standard for vehicles at or below 6,000 pounds GVWR in those same years. Note that emission credits from those Tier 3 and Tier 4 light-duty program vehicles remain in the same averaging set. ( v ) Phase-in for high-power PHEV engine starts. The following bin standards apply for high-power PHEV engine starts in model years 2027 through 2029 instead of the analogous standards specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section: Table 5 to Paragraph (b)(6)(v) \u2014Model Year 2027 Through 2029 Bin Standards for High-Power PHEV Engine Starts FEL name ACC II\u2014 High-power PHEV engine starts (mg/mile) Bin 70 320 Bin 65 300 Bin 60 280 Bin 55 260 Bin 50 240 Bin 45 220 Bin 40 200 Bin 35 175 Bin 30 150 Bin 25 125 Bin 20 100 Bin 15 75 Bin 10 50 Bin 5 25 ( vi ) MDPV. Any vehicle that becomes an MDPV as a result of the revised definition in \u00a7 86.1803-01 starting in model 2027 remains subject to the heavy-duty Tier 3 standards in \u00a7 86.1816-18 under the default phase-in specified in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section for model years 2027 through 2030. ( vii ) Keep records as needed to show that you meet the requirements specified in this paragraph (b) for phasing in standards and for complying with declining fleet average average standards. ( c ) Exhaust emission standards for \u22127 \u00b0C testing. Exhaust emissions may not exceed standards for \u22127 \u00b0C testing, as follows: ( 1 ) Measure emissions as described in 40 CFR 1066.801(c)(1) and (6) . ( 2 ) The standards apply to gasoline-fueled and diesel-fueled vehicles, except as specified. Multi-fuel, bi-fuel or dual-fuel vehicles must comply with requirements using only gasoline and diesel fuel, as applicable. Testing with other fuels such as electricity or a high-level ethanol-gasoline blend is not required. ( 3 ) The following standards apply equally for light-duty program vehicles and medium-duty vehicles: ( i ) Gasoline-fueled vehicles must meet a fleet average NMOG+NO X standard of 300 mg/mile. Calculate fleet average emission levels as described in \u00a7 86.1864 . There is no NMOG+NO X standard for diesel-fueled vehicles, but manufacturers must measure and report emissions as described in \u00a7 86.1829-15(g) . ( ii ) The PM standard is 0.5 mg/mile. ( iii ) The CO standard is 10.0 g/mile. ( 4 ) The CO standard applies at both low-altitude and high-altitude conditions. The NMOG+NO X and PM standards apply only at low-altitude conditions. However, manufacturers must submit an engineering evaluation indicating that common calibration approaches are utilized at high altitudes. Any deviation from low altitude emission control practices must be included in the auxiliary emission control device (AECD) descriptions submitted at certification. Any AECD specific to high altitude must require engineering emission data for EPA evaluation to quantify any emission impact and validity of the AECD. ( 5 ) Phase-in requirements for standards under this paragraph (c) apply as described in paragraphs (b)(6) and (f) of this section. ( d ) Special provisions for spark-ignition engines. The following A/C-on specific calibration provisions apply for vehicles with spark-ignition engines: ( 1 ) A/C-on specific calibrations ( e.g., air-fuel ratio, spark timing, and exhaust gas recirculation) that differ from A/C-off calibrations may be used for a given set of engine operating conditions ( e.g., engine speed, manifold pressure, coolant temperature, air charge temperature, and any other parameters). Such calibrations must not unnecessarily reduce emission control effectiveness during A/C-on operation when the vehicle is operated under conditions that may reasonably be expected during normal operation and use. If emission control effectiveness decreases as a result of such calibrations, the manufacturer must describe in the Application for Certification the circumstances under which this occurs and the reason for using these calibrations. ( 2 ) For AECDs involving commanded enrichment, these AECDs must not operate differently for A/C-on operation than for A/C-off operation. This includes both the sensor inputs for triggering enrichment and the degree of enrichment employed. ( e ) Off-cycle emission standards for high-GCWR vehicles. Model year 2031 and later medium-duty vehicles above 22,000 pounds GCWR must meet off-cycle emission standards as follows: ( 1 ) The engine-based off-cycle emission standards in 40 CFR 1036.104(a)(3) apply for vehicles with compression-ignition engines based on measurement procedures with 2-bin moving average windows. Manufacturers may instead meet the following alternative standards for measurement procedures with 3-bin moving average windows: Table 6 to Paragraph (e)(1) \u2014Alternative Off-Cycle Standards for High-GCWR Vehicles With Compression-Ignition Engines a Off-cycle bin NO X b HC mg/hp\u00b7hr PM mg/hp\u00b7hr CO g/hp\u00b7hr Bin 1 7.5 g/hr Bin 2a 75 mg/hp\u00b7hr 210 7.5 23.25 Bin 2b 30 mg/hp\u00b7hr 210 7.5 23.25 a Listed standards include a conformity factor of 1.5. Accuracy margins apply as described in \u00a7 86.1845-04(h) . b There is no temperature-based adjustment to the off-cycle NO X standard for testing with three-bin moving average windows. ( 2 ) The following emission standards apply for spark-ignition engines: Table 7 to Paragraph (e)(2) \u2014Off-Cycle Emission Standards for High-GCWR Vehicles With Spark-Ignition Engines a Pollutant Off-cycle emission standard NO X b 30 mg/hp\u00b7hr. HC 210 mg/hp\u00b7hr. PM 7.5 mg/hp\u00b7hr. CO 21.6 g/hp\u00b7hr. a Listed standards include a conformity factor of 1.5. b There is no temperature-based adjustment to the off-cycle NO X standard for vehicles with spark-ignition engines. ( 3 ) In-use testing requirements and measurement procedures apply as described in \u00a7 86.1845-04(h) . ( f ) Small-volume manufacturers. Small-volume manufacturers may use the following phase-in provisions for light-duty program vehicles: ( 1 ) Instead of the 25 \u00b0C fleet average NMOG+NO X standards specified in this section, small-volume manufacturers may meet alternate fleet average standards of 51 mg/mile for model year 2027 and 30 mg/mile for model years 2028 through 2031. The 15 mg/mile standard applies starting in model year 2032. ( 2 ) Instead of the phase-in specified in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, small-volume manufacturers may comply with all the requirements of this section other than the NMOG+NO X standards starting in model year 2032. [ 89 FR 28162 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1813-17 Evaporative and refueling emission standards. Vehicles must meet evaporative and refueling emission standards as specified in this section. These emission standards apply for heavy duty vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR as specified in \u00a7 86.1801 . These emission standards apply for total hydrocarbon equivalent (THCE) measurements using the test procedures specified in subpart B of this part , as appropriate. Note that \u00a7 86.1829 allows you to certify without testing in certain circumstances. These evaporative and refueling emission standards do not apply for electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, or diesel-fueled vehicles, except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, MDPVs are subject to all the same provisions of this section that apply to LDT4. ( a ) Tier 3 evaporative emission standards. Vehicles may not exceed the Tier 3 evaporative emission standards, as follows: ( 1 ) Measure emissions using the test procedures of subpart B of this part , as follows: ( i ) Follow the vehicle preconditioning and exhaust testing procedures as described in subpart B of this part . ( ii ) Measure diurnal, running loss, and hot soak emissions as shown in \u00a7 86.130 . This includes separate measurements for the two-diurnal test sequence and the three-diurnal test sequence; however, gaseous-fueled vehicles are not subject to any evaporative emission standards using the two-diurnal test sequence. ( iii ) For gasoline-fueled vehicles, use E10 test fuel as required in \u00a7 86.113 , except as specified in this section. ( iv ) Emissions are generally measured with a flame ionization detector (FID). In the case of rig, diurnal, hot soak, and running loss testing with E10 test fuel, multiply measured (unspeciated) FID values by 1.08 to account for the FID's reduced response to ethanol. However, you may instead determine total hydrocarbon equivalent for E10 testing based on speciated measurements as described in \u00a7 86.143-96(c) . You may use different methods (with or without speciation) for different test elements for a given test vehicle; however, you must always use the same method for diurnal and hot soak testing. In addition, any later testing with vehicles from that evaporative/refueling family must use the same method that was used for the original testing. Similarly, any evaporative/refueling families certified in later model years using carryover data must use the same method that was used for the original testing. We may do testing with or without speciation, but we will apply the 1.08 correction factor to unspeciated measurements for any of these four categories of evaporative emissions only if you also use it to determine your final test results. ( 2 ) Diurnal and hot soak emissions may not exceed the Tier 3 emission standards, as follows: ( i ) The emission standard for the sum of diurnal and hot soak measurements from the two-diurnal test sequence and the three-diurnal test sequence is based on a fleet average in a given model year. You must specify a family emission limit (FEL) for each evaporative family. The FEL serves as the emission standard for the evaporative family with respect to all required diurnal and hot soak testing. Calculate your fleet average emission level as described in \u00a7 86.1860 based on the FEL that applies for low-altitude testing to show that you meet the specified standard. For multi-fueled vehicles, calculate fleet average emission levels based only on emission levels for testing with gasoline. You may generate emission credits for banking and trading, and you may use banked or traded credits for demonstrating compliance with the diurnal plus hot soak emission standard for vehicles required to meet the Tier 3 standards, other than gaseous-fueled or electric vehicles, as described in \u00a7 86.1861 starting in model year 2017. You comply with the emission standard for a given model year if you have enough credits to show that your fleet average emission level is at or below the applicable standard. You may exchange credits between or among evaporative families within an averaging set as described in \u00a7 86.1861 . Separate diurnal plus hot soak emission standards apply for each evaporative/refueling emission family as shown for high-altitude conditions. The sum of diurnal and hot soak measurements may not exceed the following Tier 3 standards: Table 1 of \u00a7 86.1813-17 \u2014Tier 3 Diurnal Plus Hot Soak Emission Standards [grams per test] Vehicle category Low-altitude conditions\u2014fleet-average High-altitude conditions LDV, LDT1 0.300 0.65 LDT2 0.400 0.85 HLDT 0.500 1 1.15 HDV 0.600 1.75 1 1.25 g/test for MDPVs. ( ii ) Specify FELs as follows: ( A ) You may specify the low-altitude FEL in increments of 0.025 g above or below the otherwise applicable Tier 3 diurnal plus hot soak standard, up to the maximum values specified in the following table: Table 2 of \u00a7 86.1813-17 \u2014Tier 3 FEL Caps for Low-Altitude Testing Vehicle category FEL Caps LDV 0.500 LLDT 0.650 HLDT 0.900 MDPV 1.000 HDV 1.4 ( B ) Calculate the FEL for testing at high-altitude conditions based on the difference between the low-altitude FEL and the standard. For example, if a light-duty vehicle was certified with an FEL of 0.400 g instead of the 0.300 g standard, the FEL for testing under high-altitude conditions would be 0.75 g (0.65 + 0.10). ( iii ) Hydrocarbon emissions must not exceed 0.020 g for LDV and LDT and 0.030 g for HDV when tested using the Bleed Emission Test Procedure adopted by the California Air Resources Board as part of the LEV III program. This procedure quantifies diurnal emissions using the two-diurnal test sequence without measuring hot soak emissions. For heavy-duty vehicles with a nominal fuel tank capacity at or above 50 gallons, operate the vehicle over a second full FTP cycle before measuring diurnal emissions. The standards in this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) do not apply for testing at high-altitude conditions. For vehicles with non-integrated refueling canisters, the bleed emission test and standard do not apply to the refueling canister. You may perform the Bleed Emission Test Procedure using the analogous test temperatures and the E10 test fuel specified in subpart B of this part . ( iv ) Vehicles that become light-duty vehicles based on the change in the definition for \u201clight-duty truck\u201d for Tier 4 vehicles may continue to meet the same evaporative emission standards under this paragraph (a) through model year 2031 as long as they qualify for carryover certification as described in \u00a7 86.1839 . ( v ) Vehicles that are no longer medium-duty vehicles based on the change in the definition for \u201cmedium-duty passenger vehicles\u201d for Tier 4 vehicles may continue to meet the same evaporative emission standards under this paragraph (a) through model year 2031 as long as they qualify for carryover certification as described in \u00a7 86.1839 . ( 3 ) Running losses may not exceed 0.05 g per mile when measured using the test procedures specified in \u00a7 86.134 . This standard does not apply for gaseous-fueled vehicles. ( 4 ) Fuel systems for vehicles operating on one or more volatile liquid fuels may not exceed an effective leak diameter of 0.02 inches when measured using the procedure specified in 40 CFR 1066.985 . For vehicles with fuel tanks exceeding 25 gallons nominal fuel tank capacity, you may request our approval for a leak standard greater than 0.020 inches, up to a maximum value of 0.040 inches. ( 5 ) The Tier 3 evaporative emission standards start to phase in with model year 2017 for vehicles at or below 6,000 pounds GVWR and with model year 2018 for vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR. Table 3 of this section specifies the minimum percentage of each manufacturer's sales in each model year that must be certified to the Tier 3 evaporative emission standards. Calculate annual percentages based on actual nationwide sales of all vehicles subject to standards under this paragraph (a) for the applicable model year; however, if all your FELs for Tier 3 evaporative families are at the applicable standard (neither generating nor using emission credits), the phase-in requirements are based on projected sales. Also, if you certify vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR to the Tier 3 evaporative emission standards in model year 2017, you may count projected U.S. sales of those vehicles toward your calculation for meeting the 40 percent requirement in 2017 (numerator only). Manufacturers may meet this requirement using the additional alternative phase-in provisions in paragraph (g) of this section. Vehicles from the identified model years not certified to the Tier 3 evaporative emission standards continue to be subject to the evaporative emission standards specified in \u00a7 86.1811-09(e) or \u00a7 86.1816-08(d) , including the useful life provisions of \u00a7 86.1805-12 . Note that this subjects LDV and LDT1 to a 150,000 mile useful life for evaporative emissions if the vehicles are subject to a 150,000 mile useful life for exhaust emissions. Keep records as needed to show that you meet the phase-in requirements specified in this section. See paragraph (g) of this section for additional provisions that apply for model year 2017 and the rest of the phase-in. Table 3 of \u00a7 86.1813-17 \u2014Default Phase-In Schedule for Tier 3 Evaporative Emission Standards Model year Minimum percentage of vehicles subject to the Tier 3 standards 2017 40 1 2 2018 60 2019 60 2020 80 2021 80 2022 100 1 The phase-in percentage for model year 2017 applies only for vehicles at or below 6,000 pounds GVWR. 2 The leak standard specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section does not apply for model year 2017. ( 6 ) For model year 2017, exclude vehicle sales from California and section 177 states from the calculation to demonstrate compliance with the phase-in schedule in paragraph (a)(5) or (g) of this section, and from the credit calculation in \u00a7 86.1860 . ( b ) Refueling emissions. Light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles must meet the refueling emission standards in this paragraph (b) as follows when measured over the procedure specified in \u00a7 86.150 : ( 1 ) The following implementation dates apply for incomplete heavy-duty vehicles: ( i ) Refueling standards apply starting with model year 2027 for incomplete heavy-duty vehicles certified under 40 CFR part 1037 and in model year 2030 for incomplete heavy-duty vehicles certified under this subpart, unless the manufacturer complies with the alternate phase-in specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. If you do not meet the alternative phase-in requirement for model year 2026, you must certify all your incomplete heavy-duty vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR to the refueling standard in model year 2027. ( ii ) Refueling standards are optional for incomplete heavy-duty vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR through model year 2029, unless the manufacturer uses the alternate phase-in specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section to meet standards together for heavy-duty vehicles above and below 14,000 pounds GVWR. ( iii ) Manufacturers may comply with an alternate phase-in of the refueling standard for incomplete heavy-duty vehicles as described in this paragraph (b)(1)(iii) . Manufacturers must meet the refueling standard during the phase-in based on their projected nationwide production volume of all incomplete heavy-duty vehicles subject to standards under this subpart and under 40 CFR part 1037 as described in Table 4 of this section. Keep records as needed to show that you meet phase-in requirements. Table 4 of \u00a7 86.1813-17 \u2014Alternative Phase-In Schedule for Refueling Emission Standards for Incomplete Heavy-Duty Vehicles Model year Minimum percentage of heavy-duty vehicles subject to the refueling standard 2026 40 2027 40 2028 80 2029 80 2030 100 ( 2 ) The following refueling standards apply: ( i ) 0.20 g THCE per gallon of fuel dispensed for vehicles using volatile liquid fuels. This standard also applies for diesel-fueled LDV. ( ii ) 0.15 g THC per gallon of fuel dispensed for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles and natural gas-fueled vehicles. ( c ) Fuel spitback. For vehicles fueled by volatile liquid fuels, fuel spitback emissions may not exceed 1.0 g THCE when measured using the test procedures specified in \u00a7 86.146 . The fuel spitback standard applies only to newly assembled vehicles. ( d ) [Reserved] ( e ) Auxiliary engines and separate fuel systems. The provisions of 40 CFR 1037.103(g) apply for vehicles with auxiliary engines. This includes any engines installed in the final vehicle configuration that contribute no motive power through the vehicle's transmission. ( f ) Refueling provisions for gaseous-fueled vehicles. The following provisions apply specifically for gaseous-fueled vehicles: ( 1 ) Compressed natural gas vehicles must meet the requirements for fueling connection devices as specified in ANSI NGV1-2006 or CSA IR-1-15 (incorporated by reference in \u00a7 86.1 ). ( 2 ) [Reserved] ( 3 ) With our advance approval, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles with gauges or valves that can be opened to release fuel or fuel vapor during refueling (such as fixed liquid level gauges) may be tested for refueling emissions without opening such gauges or valves, as outlined in \u00a7 86.157-98(d)(2) . We will approve your request if you can show that such gauges or valves will not be open during in-use refueling due to inaccessibility or other design features that would prevent them from opening or make this very unlikely. ( g ) Alternative phase-in options for Tier 3 evaporative emission standards. You may use any of the following alternative methods to transition to the Tier 3 evaporative emission standards: ( 1 ) Starting in model year 2015, you may earn an \u201callowance\u201d for each vehicle that you certify early under this paragraph (g)(1) . For each allowance you earn, you may count it as one compliant vehicle in a later model year during the phase-in period. Calculate the total phase-in percentage in each model year by adding the allowances to the number of compliant vehicles (in the numerator), without increasing total sales (in the denominator). For each allowance you earn, you may alternatively count it as one compliant vehicle under the phase-in schedule described in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, except that you may not use those allowances to increase the value of the phase-in index from any model year by more than 10 percentage points. Vehicles earning allowances under this paragraph (g)(1) may not have an FEL above the applicable Tier 3 standard, and may not generate emission credits for banking or trading. Allowances may not be traded to another company. You may earn allowances under this paragraph (g)(1) for early-compliant vehicles as follows: ( i ) Model year 2015 and 2016 vehicles at or below 6,000 pounds GVWR meeting the Tier 3 standards in paragraph (a) of this section or the equivalent California standards as specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section earn allowances, as long as the vehicles are not sold in California or any of the section 177 states. ( ii ) Model year 2015 through 2017 LDV and LDT above 6,000 pounds GVWR meeting the Tier 3 standards in paragraph (a) of this section or the equivalent California standards as specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section earn allowances, as long as the vehicles are not sold in California or any of the section 177 states. ( iii ) Model year 2015 through 2017 MDPV and HDV meeting the Tier 3 standards in paragraph (a) of this section or the equivalent California standards as specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section earn allowances for vehicles sold in any state. ( iv ) To the extent that you over-comply with the 40-percent phase-in requirement in model year 2017, you may count your actual U.S. sales exceeding the required number of Tier 3 vehicles as allowances toward meeting the phase-in requirement in 2018 and later model years. ( v ) For HDV above 10,000 pounds GVWR and at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR that you certify to the refueling emission standards in paragraph (b) of this section in model years 2015 through 2017 and sell outside of California and the section 177 states, a single vehicle may produce two allowances if it is certified to the Tier 3 diurnal plus hot soak standard. Allowances earned under this paragraph (g)(1)(v) may alternatively be used in model years 2018 through 2022 to phase in the refueling standard, except that a single early-compliant vehicle produces only a single allowance. ( vi ) Complete HDV above 14,000 pounds GVWR and all sizes of incomplete HDV earn allowances as described in paragraph (g)(1)(v) of this section if they are certified to the refueling emission standards in paragraph (b) of this section in model years 2015 through 2021. ( 2 ) The following alternative phase-in options apply for model year 2017: ( i ) You may disregard the percentage phase-in specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section for 2017 if you choose 50-state certification for all your vehicles meeting the LEV III PZEV evaporative standards in 2017. Under this option, you may not produce a higher-emitting version of those vehicle models for sale outside of California or the section 177 states. Such vehicles may be certified using carryover data under the California program, but they may not generate or use emission credits. LDV and LDT1 that comply under this paragraph (g)(2)(i) may not generate allowances under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, regardless of the calculated percentage of compliant vehicles in model year 2017. ( ii ) You may comply with the phase-in requirement for model year 2017 by meeting the Tier 3 emission standards for diurnal plus hot soak, running loss, and bleed emissions (or the equivalent set of California standards as allowed in this section) with 20 percent of vehicles at or below 6,000 pounds GVWR, and by meeting the leak standard in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section with 20 percent of vehicles at or below 6,000 pounds GVWR. You may optionally include vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR under this paragraph (g)(2)(ii) to calculate the percentage (numerator only) if they meet the leak and/or evaporative emission standards in model year 2017. Vehicles complying with Tier 3 evaporative emission standards may generate or use emission credits relative to the diurnal plus hot soak standard as specified in this section, but they may not generate allowances. You may apply this option and use the alternative phase-in calculation in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, subject to the following conditions: ( A ) You must meet or exceed the 20 percent threshold for both evaporative emissions and the leak standard. ( B ) All the vehicles meeting the leak standard must also meet the Tier 3 evaporative emission standards. Through model year 2026, all vehicles meeting the leak standard must also meet the OBD requirements in \u00a7 86.1806-17(b)(1) . ( C ) Determine the appropriate percentage for calculating compliance under paragraph (g)(4) of this section by adding 20 to the percentage of vehicles meeting the Tier 3 evaporative emission standards to account for vehicles meeting the leak standard. Do not increase the percentage based on meeting the leak standard with more than 20 percent of your vehicles in model year 2017. ( 3 ) If you certify model year 2021 or earlier vehicles to the LEV III evaporative emission standards in California, you may certify those as Tier 3 vehicles that count toward meeting the phase-in requirements of this section. Such vehicles must still be certified to the high-altitude standards in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the leak standard specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. You may not certify vehicles under this paragraph (g)(3) after model year 2021. Vehicles meeting the LEV III standards may also generate allowances under paragraph (g)(1) of this section; however, these vehicles may generate or use emission credits under this subpart only if they are not used to generate allowances and if they are certified using the Option 2 procedures under the LEV III program (including the bleed emission test). Vehicles may be certified under this paragraph (g)(3) based on the rig test (\u201cOption 1\u201d) if they are certified to LEV III standards based on the rig test before model year 2017; this certification option applies through model year 2021. Include these Option 1 vehicles in the calculation of fleet average emissions by using the appropriate Tier 3 emission standard as the FEL. Note that the rig test is considered a diurnal test with respect to the provisions to account for ethanol emissions as described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section. ( 4 ) If you fall short of the phase-in percentage specifications in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may designate the requisite number of Tier 2 vehicles as Tier 3 vehicles for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the Tier 3 standards in this section. To do this, factor those Tier 2 vehicles into the Tier 3 fleet-average emission calculation using an FEL that is equal to the applicable diurnal plus hot soak standard from the two-day test sequence. The Tier 3 emission standards do not apply to these Tier 2 vehicles. In addition, you may disregard the phase-in percentages specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section if you instead comply based on one of the following alternative measures: ( i ) You may comply with an alternate phase-in schedule described in this paragraph (g)(4)(i) . To do this, you must give us a detailed plan for describing how you will meet the alternate phase-in schedule. You comply with the alternate phase-in schedule by calculating an evaporative phase-in index using the following equation that is at or above 1,280 for model years 2017 through 2022 (or 1,040 for model years 2018 through 2022 if you use the provisions of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section): Evaporative phase-in index = 6\u00b7APP 2017 + 5\u00b7APP 2018 + 4\u00b7APP 2019 + 3\u00b7APP 2020 + 2\u00b7APP 2021 + APP 2022 Where: APP = The phase-in percentage of vehicles meeting the Tier 3 evaporative emission standards for the indicated model year, based on actual sales, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. ( ii ) You may comply with an alternate phase-in schedule described in this paragraph (g)(4)(ii) . To do this, you must give us a detailed plan for describing how you will meet the alternate phase-in schedule. You comply with the alternate phase-in schedule by calculating an evaporative phase-in index using the following equation that is at or above 420 for model years 2017 through 2022 (or 380 for model years 2018 through 2022 if you use the provisions of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section): Evaporative phase-in index = APP 2017 + APP 2018 + APP 2019 + APP 2020 + APP 2021 + APP 2022 Where: APP = The phase-in percentage of vehicles meeting the Tier 3 evaporative emission standards for the indicated model year, based on actual sales, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. ( 5 ) This paragraph (g)(5) describes an alternative approach to phasing in the evaporative and refueling emission standards for gaseous-fueled vehicles above 8,500 pounds GVWR. Under this alternative phase-in, you may disregard the requirements of this section related to evaporative emission standards that apply for these vehicles before model year 2019. Similarly, you may disregard the refueling emission standards of this section before model year 2019 for vehicles above 10,000 pounds GVWR. For model year 2019, you may exclude from the phase-in calculation any evaporative families with vehicles that have a Job 1 date on or before March 3, 2018 (see 40 CFR 85.2304 ). Any vehicles not subject to Tier 3 evaporative emission standards during this phase-in period must continue to comply with the evaporative emission standards in \u00a7 86.1816-08(d) ; such vehicles are subject to the useful life provisions in \u00a7 86.1805-12 relative to evaporative emission standards. Each vehicle counting toward the phase-in percentage under this paragraph (g)(5) must meet all the standards that apply throughout the useful life as specified in \u00a7 86.1805-17 . ( h ) Small-volume manufacturers. Small-volume manufacturers meeting the eligibility requirements in \u00a7 86.1838 may delay complying with the requirements in this section until model year 2022. If meeting the Tier 3 standards would cause severe economic hardship, such manufacturers may ask us to approve an extended compliance deadline under the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.250 , except that the solvency criterion does not apply and there is no maximum duration of the hardship relief. [ 79 FR 23718 , Apr. 28, 2014, as amended at 80 FR 9107 , Feb. 19, 2015; 81 FR 73984 , Oct. 25, 2016; 86 FR 34371 , June 29, 2021; 88 FR 4478 , Jan. 24, 2023; 89 FR 28166 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1815-27 Battery-related requirements for battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Except as specified in paragraph (h) of this section, battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles must meet requirements related to batteries serving as a Rechargeable Energy Storage System from GTR No. 22 (incorporated by reference, see \u00a7 86.1 ). The requirements of this section apply starting in model year 2027 for vehicles at or below 6,000 pounds GVWR. The requirements of this section start to apply for vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR when they are first certified to Tier 4 NMOG+NO X bin standards under \u00a7 86.1811-27(b) , not later than model year 2031. The following clarifications and adjustments to GTR No. 22 apply for vehicles subject to this section: ( a ) Manufacturers must install an operator-accessible display that monitors, estimates, and communicates the vehicle's State of Certified Energy (SOCE) and include information in the application for certification as described in \u00a7 86.1844 . Display SOCE as a percentage expressed at least to the nearest whole number. Manufacturers that qualify as small businesses under \u00a7 86.1801-12(j)(1) must meet the requirements of this paragraph (a) but are not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section; however, small businesses may trade credits they generate from battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles for a given model year only if they meet requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section. ( b ) Requirements in GTR No. 22 related to State of Certified Range do not apply. ( c ) Evaluate SOCE based on measured Usable Battery Energy (UBE) values. Use the Multi-Cycle Range and Energy Consumption Test described in 40 CFR 600.116-12(a) for battery electric vehicles and either the UDDS Full Charge Test (FCT) or the HFET FCT as described in 40 CFR 600.116-12(c)(11) for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. For medium-duty vehicles, perform testing with test weight set to Adjusted Loaded Vehicle Weight. ( d ) In-use vehicles must display SOCE values that are accurate within 5 percent of measured values as calculated in GTR No. 22. ( e ) Batteries installed in light-duty program vehicles must meet a Minimum Performance Requirement such that measured usable battery energy is at least 80 percent of the vehicle's certified usable battery energy after 5 years or 62,000 miles, and at least 70 percent of certified usable battery energy at 8 years or 100,000 miles. ( f ) Manufacturers must divide test groups into families and perform testing and submit reports as follows: ( 1 ) Identify battery durability families and monitor families as specified in Section 6.1 of GTR No. 22. Include vehicles in the same battery durability family only if there are no chemistry differences that would be expected to influence durability, such as proportional metal composition of the cathode, composition of the anode, or differences in particle size or morphology of cathode or anode active materials. ( 2 ) Perform Part A testing to verify that SOCE monitors meet accuracy requirements as described in \u00a7 86.1845-04 . Test the number of vehicles and determine a pass or fail result as specified in Section 6.3 of GTR No. 22. ( 3 ) For light-duty program vehicles, perform Part B verification for each battery durability family included in a monitor family subject to Part A testing to verify that batteries have SOCE meeting the Minimum Performance Requirement. Determine performance by reading SOCE monitors with a physical inspection, remote inspection using wireless technology, or any other appropriate means. ( i ) Randomly select test vehicles from at least 10 different U.S. states or territories, with no more than 50 percent of selected vehicles coming from any one state or territory. Select vehicles to represent a wide range of climate conditions and operating characteristics. ( ii ) Select at least 500 test vehicles per year from each from each battery durability family, except that we may approve your request to select fewer vehicles for a given battery durability family based on limited production volumes. If you test fewer than 500 vehicles, you may exclude up to 5 percent of the tested vehicles to account for the limited sample size. Test vehicles may be included from year to year, or test vehicles may change over the course of testing for the battery durability family. ( iii ) A battery durability family passes if 90 percent or more of sampled vehicles have reported values at or above the Minimum Performance Requirement. ( iv ) Continue testing for eight years after the end of production for vehicles included in the battery durability family. Note that testing will typically require separate testing from multiple model years in a given calendar year. ( 4 ) You may request our approval to group monitors and batteries differently, or to adjust testing specifications. Submit your request with your proposed alternative specifications, along with technical justification. In the case of broadening the scope of a monitor family, include data demonstrating that differences within the proposed monitor family do not cause error in estimating SOCE.

These vehicles must comply with all other requirements applicable to model year 2008 vehicles, except as allowed by paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section. The combined number of vehicles in the test groups certified to the 2007 standards may not exceed 50 percent of the manufacturer's U.S. heavy-duty vehicle sales of complete heavy-duty Otto-cycle motor vehicles for model year 2008. ( 2 ) ( i ) Manufacturers certifying vehicles to all of the applicable standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section prior to model year 2008 (without using credits) may reduce the number of vehicles that are required to meet the standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section in model year 2008 and/or 2009, taking into account the phase-in option provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section. For every vehicle that is certified early, the manufacturer may reduce the number of vehicles that are required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section to meet the standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section by one vehicle. For example, if a manufacturer produces 100 heavy-duty Otto-cycle vehicles in 2007 that meet all of the applicable the standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section, and it produced 10,000 heavy-duty Otto-cycle vehicles in 2009, then only 9,900 of the vehicles would need to comply with the standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section. ( ii ) Manufacturers certifying vehicles to all of the applicable evaporative standards listed in paragraph (d) of this section prior to model year 2008 may reduce the number of vehicles that are required to meet the standards listed in paragraph (d) of this section in model year 2008 and/or 2009, taking into account the phase-in option provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section. For every vehicle that is certified early, the manufacturer may reduce the number of vehicles that are required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section to meet the evaporative standards listed in paragraph (d) of this section by one vehicle. ( 3 ) Manufacturers certifying vehicles to all of the applicable standards listed in paragraph (i)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section (without using credits) and the evaporative standards listed in paragraph (d) of this section prior to model year 2008 may reduce the number of vehicles that are required to meet the standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section in model year 2008 and/or 2009, taking into account the phase-in option provided in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section. For every such vehicle that is certified early with sufficiently low emissions, the manufacturer may reduce the number of vehicles that are required by paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section to meet the standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section by two vehicles. The applicable standards are: ( i ) For complete heavy-duty vehicles at and above 8,500 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating but equal to or less than 10,000 Gross Vehicle Weight Rating: 0.100 g/mile NMHC, 0.10 g/mile NO X , 3.2 g/mile CO, 0.008 g/mile formaldehyde, and 0.02 g/mile PM. ( ii ) For complete heavy-duty vehicles at or above 10,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating but equal to or less than 14,000 Gross Vehicle Weight Rating: 0.117 g/mile NMHC, 0.20 g/mile NO X , 3.7 g/mile CO, 0.010 g/mile formaldehyde, and 0.02 g/mile PM.

( 2 ) The in-use adjustments are: ( i ) 0.1 g/mi for NO X . ( ii ) 0.100 g/mi NMHC. ( iii ) 0.01 g/mi for PM. [ 66 FR 5190 , Jan. 18, 2001, as amended at 70 FR 40443 , July 13, 2005] \u00a7 86.1816-18 Emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles. ( a ) Applicability and general provisions. This section describes Tier 3 exhaust emission standards for complete heavy-duty vehicles. These standards are optional for incomplete heavy-duty vehicles and for heavy-duty vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR as described in \u00a7 86.1801 . Greenhouse gas emission standards are specified in \u00a7 86.1818 for MDPV and in \u00a7 86.1819 for other HDV. See \u00a7 86.1813 for evaporative and refueling emission standards. This section starts to apply in model year 2018, except that the provisions may apply to vehicles before model year 2018 as specified in paragraph (b)(11) of this section. This section applies for model year 2027 and later vehicles only as specified in \u00a7 86.1811-27 . Separate requirements apply for MDPV as specified in \u00a7 86.1811 . See subpart A of this part for requirements that apply for incomplete heavy-duty vehicles and for heavy-duty engines certified independent of the chassis. The following general provisions apply: ( 1 ) Test all vehicles as described in this section using a chassis dynamometer; establish appropriate load settings based on adjusted loaded vehicle weight (see \u00a7 86.1803 ). ( 2 ) Some provisions apply differently depending on the vehicle's power-to-weight ratio. Determine a vehicle's power-to-weight ratio by dividing the engine's rated power by the vehicle's GVWR (in hp/pound). For purposes of this section, if a test group includes multiple configurations, use the vehicle with the highest power-to-weight ratio to characterize the test group. ( 3 ) Use E10 test fuel as required in \u00a7 86.113 , except as specified in this section. ( 4 ) Measure emissions from hybrid electric vehicles (including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) as described in 40 CFR part 1066, subpart F , except that these procedures do not apply for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles during charge-depleting operation. ( b ) Tier 3 exhaust emission standards. Exhaust emissions may not exceed the Tier 3 exhaust emission standards, as follows: ( 1 ) Measure emissions using the procedures of subpart B of this part , using specific driving schedules and additional procedures as follows: ( i ) The Federal Test Procedure (FTP) is based on testing with the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) specified in paragraph (a) of Appendix I of this part . ( ii ) The Heavy-Duty Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (HD-SFTP) involves testing with the UDDS, the SC03 driving schedule specified in paragraph (h) of Appendix I of this part , and one of the following additional driving schedules: ( A ) For Class 2b vehicles, the US06 driving schedule specified in paragraph (g) of Appendix I of this part . ( B ) For Class 2b vehicles with a power-to-weight ratio at or below 0.024 hp/pound that are certified to optional standards under paragraphs (b)(2) and (4) of this section, the highway portion of the US06 driving schedule characterized as the \u201csecond bag\u201d in \u00a7 86.159-08(a) . ( C ) For Class 3 vehicles, the Hot LA-92 driving schedule as specified in paragraph (c) of Appendix I of this part . ( iii ) HD-SFTP emissions are calculated as a composite of test results over these driving schedules based on the following calculation: HD-SFTP (g/mi) = 0.35\u00b7FTP + 0.28\u00b7HDSIM + 0.37\u00b7SC03 Where: HDSIM = the appropriate driving schedule specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. ( iv ) You may alternatively use FTP emission results to substitute for the SC03 value in the calculation under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section for a given vehicle for any testing under this section. Such vehicles remain subject to the SFTP standard when tested over the SC03 driving schedule. ( v ) Hydrocarbon emission standards are expressed as NMOG; however, you may measure exhaust emissions based on nonmethane hydrocarbon instead of NMOG as described in 40 CFR 1066.635 . ( 2 ) Table 1 of this section describes fully phased-in Tier 3 standards that apply as specified in this paragraph (b) for the identified driving schedules. The FTP standards for NMOG + NO X apply on a fleet-average basis using discrete bin standards as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The bin standards include additional emission standards for CO emissions, and for NMOG + NO X standards when testing over the HD-SFTP driving schedule. Table 1 follows: Table 1 of \u00a7 86.1816-18 \u2014Fully Phased-in Tier 3 HDV Exhaust Emission Standards [Tg/mile] HDV class Fleet-average NMOG + NO X PM Formaldehyde FTP FTP HD-SFTP FTP 2b 0.178 0.008 0.010 1 0.006 3 0.247 0.010 0.007 0.006 1 For vehicles with a power-to-weight ratio at or below 0.024 hp/pound that are certified using the driving schedule described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the HD-SFTP standard for PM is 0.007 g/mile instead of the value specified in the table. ( 3 ) The FTP standards specified in this section apply equally for testing at low-altitude conditions and high-altitude conditions. The HD-SFTP standards described in this section apply only for testing at low-altitude conditions. ( 4 ) The FTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X is based on a fleet average in a given model year. You must specify a family emission limit (FEL) for each test group. The FEL serves as the emission standard for the test group with respect to all required FTP testing. Calculate your fleet-average emission level as described in \u00a7 86.1860 to show that you meet the specified standard. For multi-fueled vehicles, calculate fleet-average emission levels based only on emission levels for testing with gasoline or diesel fuel. You may generate or use emission credits for banking and trading and you may use banked or traded credits for demonstrating compliance with the FTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X as described in \u00a7 86.1861 . You comply with the emission standard for a given model year if you have enough credits to show that your fleet-average emission level is at or below the applicable standard. You may exchange credits between or among any test groups subject to standards under this section. Specify one of the identified values from Table 2 or Table 3 of this section as the FEL for demonstrating that your fleet-average emission level complies with the FTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X . These FEL values define emission bins that also determine corresponding emission standards for NMOG + NO X emissions over the HD-SFTP driving schedule and for CO emissions, as follows: Table 2 of \u00a7 86.1816-18 \u2014Tier 3 Bin Standards\u2014Class 2 b [g/mile] FEL Name NMOG + NO X CO FTP (FEL) HD-SFTP 1 FTP HD-SFTP Bin 250 0.250 0.800 6.4 22.0 Bin 200 0.200 0.800 4.2 22.0 Bin 170 0.170 0.450 4.2 12.0 Bin 150 0.150 0.450 3.2 12.0 Bin 0 2 0.000 0.000 0.0 0.0 1 Vehicles with a power-to-weight ratio at or below 0.024 hp/pound that are certified using the driving schedule described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the following HD-SFTP bin standards for NMOG + NO X apply instead of those identified in the table: 0.350 g/mile for Bin 150 and Bin 170; and 0.550 g/mile for Bin 200 and Bin 250. 2 Vehicles certified to Bin 0 must also meet PM and formaldehyde standards of 0.000 g/mile instead of the standards specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Table 3 of \u00a7 86.1816-18 \u2014Tier 3 Bin Standards\u2014Class 3 [g/mile] FEL Name NMOG + NO X CO FTP (FEL) HD-SFTP FTP HD-SFTP Bin 400 0.400 0.550 7.3 6.0 Bin 270 0.270 0.550 4.2 6.0 Bin 230 0.230 0.350 4.2 4.0 Bin 200 0.200 0.350 3.7 4.0 Bin 0 1 0.000 0.000 0.0 0.0 1 Vehicles certified to Bin 0 must also meet PM and formaldehyde standards of 0.000 g/mile instead of the standards specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. ( 5 ) [Reserved] ( 6 ) The full Tier 3 program includes new emission standards for NMOG + NO X , PM, CO, and formaldehyde; it also includes measurement with a new test fuel and a longer useful life. Vehicles meeting all these requirements are considered Final Tier 3 vehicles. Vehicles that do not meet all the Tier 3 requirements are considered Interim Tier 3 vehicles. The Tier 3 PM standards phase in over several years. Any vehicles not subject to Tier 3 PM standards during the phase-in period must continue to comply with the PM standards in \u00a7 86.1816-08 . Paragraph (b)(7) of this section describes how to transition to Tier 3 standards for emissions other than PM. The following provisions describe the primary approach for phasing in the Tier 3 PM standards: ( i ) You must meet the FTP emission standard for PM with 20, 40, 70, and 100 percent of your projected nationwide sales of all vehicles subject to this section in model years 2018 through 2021, respectively. Each vehicle meeting the Tier 3 FTP standard for PM must also meet the Tier 3 HD-SFTP standard for PM. ( ii ) You may disregard the phase-in percentages specified in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section if you instead comply with an indexed PM phase-in schedule as described in this paragraph (b)(6)(ii) . To do this, you must notify us of your intent before January 1, 2018, and include a detailed plan for complying with the indexed phase-in schedule. You comply with the indexed phase-in schedule by calculating a PM phase-in index at or above 440 using the following equation for model years 2018 through 2021: PM phase-in index = 4\u00b7APP 2018 + 3\u00b7APP 2019 + 2\u00b7APP 2020 + APP 2021 Where: APP = The phase-in percentage of vehicles meeting the Tier 3 PM standards for the indicated model year, based on actual sales. ( iii ) Vehicles meeting the Tier 3 PM standards must meet those standards over the useful life as specified in \u00a7 86.1805 . Note that Interim Tier 3 vehicles may have different useful life values for PM emission standards than for other emission standards. ( iv ) Measure PM emissions from all vehicles using the same test fuel used for measuring NMOG + NO X emissions. ( v ) You may certify Interim Tier 3 vehicles based on carryover data. ( vi ) You may use the alternative phase-in provisions described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section to transition to the Tier 3 exhaust emission standards on a different schedule. ( 7 ) The following provisions describe the primary approach for phasing in the Tier 3 standards other than PM in 2022 and earlier model years: ( i ) The fleet-average FTP emission standard for NMOG + NO X phases in over several years as described in this paragraph (b)(7)(i) . You must identify FELs as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section and calculate a fleet-average emission level to show that you meet the FTP emission standard for NMOG+NO X that applies for each model year. You may certify using transitional bin standards specified in Table 5 of this section through model year 2021; these vehicles are subject to the FTP emission standard for formaldehyde as described in \u00a7 86.1816-08 . You may use the E0 test fuel specified in \u00a7 86.113 for gasoline-fueled vehicles certified to the transitional bins; the useful life period for these vehicles is 120,000 miles or 11 years. Fleet-average FTP emission standards decrease as shown in the following table: Table 4 of \u00a7 86.1816-18 \u2014Declining Fleet-Average FTP Emission Standards for NMOG + NO X [g/mile] Model Year Class 2b Class 3 2016 1 0.333 0.548 2017 1 0.310 0.508 2018 0.278 0.451 2019 0.253 0.400 2020 0.228 0.349 2021 0.203 0.298 2022 0.178 0.247 1 Fleet-average standards are shown for 2016 and 2017 for purposes of voluntary early compliance as described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section.

( ii ) You may use the alternative phase-in provisions described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section to transition to the Tier 3 exhaust emission standards on a different schedule. ( 8 ) This paragraph (b)(8) describes an alternative approach to phasing in the Tier 3 emission standards. If you choose this approach, you must phase in the Tier 3 standards for all your vehicles subject to this section according to this schedule. Under this alternative phase in, you must meet all the standards specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section according to the phase-in schedule specified in Table 6 of this section based on the indicated percentage of your projected nationwide sales in each model year. These vehicles must meet the applicable FTP emission standard for CO and the HD-SFTP emission standards for NMOG + NO X and CO that apply for Class 2b Bin 170 and Class 3 Bin 230 as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Any vehicles not subject to Tier 3 standards during the phase-in period must continue to comply with the gaseous exhaust emission standards in \u00a7 86.1816-08 . Each vehicle counting toward the PM phase-in percentage under this paragraph (b)(8) in model years 2019 and 2020 must also be included in the portion of the fleet meeting the Tier 3 standards for pollutants other than PM. Each vehicle counting toward the phase-in percentage for any pollutant must use the Tier 3 test fuel specified in \u00a7 86.113-15 . The following exceptions and special provisions apply under this paragraph (b)(8) : ( i ) For model year 2019, you may exclude from the phase-in calculation any test groups that have a Job 1 date on or before March 3, 2018 (see 40 CFR 85.2304 ). ( ii ) You may generate Tier 3 emission credits during the phase-in period if all your pre-Tier 3 vehicles in a given model year have FELs at or below the NO X and NMHC standards in \u00a7 86.1816-08 . Determine emission credits by calculating fleet-average emission levels for Tier 3 and pre-Tier 3 vehicles together; for pre-Tier 3 vehicles use an NMOG + NO X equivalent FEL of 0.395 g/mile for Class 2b vehicles and 0.630 g/mile for Class 3 vehicles. Table 6 of \u00a7 86.1816-18 \u2014Alternative Phase-In Schedule Model Year Class 2b Class 3 PM (percent) Other than PM (percent) PM (percent) Other than PM (percent) 2019 40 65 40 60 2020 70 77 70 73 2021 100 88 100 87 2022 100 100 100 100 ( 9 ) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, you may not use credits generated from vehicles certified under \u00a7 86.1816-08 for demonstrating compliance with the Tier 3 standards. ( 10 ) [Reserved] ( 11 ) You may voluntarily certify your vehicles under this section in model years 2016 and 2017. If you do this, the fleet-average FTP emission standards for NMOG + NO X apply to all your heavy-duty vehicles under this section as specified in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section. Use any of the available bin standards as described in this section. Vehicles certified under this paragraph (b)(11) must comply with the PM standards specified in \u00a7 86.1816-08 instead of the Tier 3 PM standards specified in this section. ( 12 ) Alternate standards apply for in-use testing with 2022 and earlier model year vehicles as described in this paragraph (b)(12) . These alternate standards apply in the first model year that a test group is certified to Tier 3 FTP or HD-SFTP standards for NMOG + NO X or PM under this section. The alternate in-use standards also apply in the following model year (but not beyond 2022) for carryover test groups certified to the same bin standards. If you certify a test group to more stringent bin standards under this section in a given model year, the alternate in-use standards apply as if that were the first model year of certifying to the Tier 3 standards. The provisions of this section apply separately for NMOG + NO X and PM. This paragraph (b)(12) does not apply for Bin 0 vehicles. ( i ) The alternate in-use FTP standards for PM are 0.016 g/mile for Class 2b vehicles and 0.020 g/mile for Class 3 vehicles. ( ii ) The alternate in-use HD-SFTP standards for PM are 0.012 g/mile for Class 2b vehicles with a power-to-weight ratio at or below 0.024 hp/pound that are certified to optional standards under paragraphs (b)(2) and (4) of this section, and 0.015 g/mile for other Class 2b vehicles. The alternate in-use HD-SFTP standard for PM is 0.012 g/mile for Class 3 vehicles. Alternate in-use HD-SFTP standards do not apply for vehicles certified to the transitional bins described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section. ( iii ) Alternate in-use FTP and HD-SFTP standards for NMOG + NO X apply as specified in the following table: Table 7 of \u00a7 86.1816-18 \u2014Alternate In-use NMOG + NO X Standards [ g /mile] Class FEL name FTP HD-SFTP 1 2b Bin 250 0.370 1.120 Bin 200 0.300 1.120 Bin 170 0.250 0.630 Bin 150 0.220 0.630 3 Bin 400 0.600 0.770 Bin 270 0.400 0.770 Bin 230 0.340 0.490 Bin 200 0.300 0.490 1 For Class 2b vehicles with a power-to-weight ratio at or below 0.024 hp/pound that are certified to optional standards under paragraphs (b)(2) and (4) of this section, the following alternate in-use HD-SFTP standards for NMOG + NO X apply instead of those identified in the table: 0.490 g/mile for Bin 150 and Bin 170; and 0.770 g/mile for Bin 200 and Bin 250. Note that vehicles certified to transitional Tier 3 FTP bins are not subject to HD-SFTP standards. ( 13 ) Keep records as needed to show that you meet the requirements specified in this paragraph (b) for phasing in standards and for complying with declining fleet-average average standards. ( 14 ) Starting in model year 2027, you may certify vehicles using the following transitional Tier 4 bins as part of the compliance demonstration for meeting the Tier 4 declining fleet average NMOG+NO X standard in \u00a7 86.1811-27(b)(6) : Table 8 of \u00a7 86.1816-18 \u2014Transitional Tier 4 Bin Standards\u2014Class 2 b [g/mile] FEL name NMOG+NO X CO FTP (FEL) HD-SFTP FTP HD-SFTP Bin 125 0.125 0.125 3.2 12.0 Bin 100 0.100 0.100 3.2 12.0 Bin 85 0.085 0.085 3.2 12.0 Bin 75 0.075 0.075 3.2 12.0 Table 9 of \u00a7 86.1816-18 \u2014Transitional Tier 4 Bin Standards\u2014Class 3 [g/mile] FEL name NMOG+NO X CO FTP (FEL) HD-SFTP FTP HD-SFTP Bin 170 0.170 0.170 3.7 4.0 Bin 150 0.150 0.150 3.7 4.0 Bin 125 0.125 0.125 3.7 4.0 Bin 100 0.100 0.100 3.7 4.0 Bin 85 0.085 0.085 3.7 4.0 Bin 75 0.075 0.075 3.7 4.0 ( c ) Highway NMOG + NO X exhaust emission standard. For vehicles certified to any of the Tier 3 standards specified in paragraph (b) of this section, NMOG + NO X emissions measured on the highway test cycle in 40 CFR 1066.840 may not exceed the applicable NMOG + NO X bin standard for FTP testing. Demonstrate compliance with this standard for low-mileage vehicles by applying the appropriate deterioration factor. ( d ) Provisions for Otto-cycle engines. The special provisions described in \u00a7 86.1811-17(d) apply to vehicles with Otto-cycle engines that are certified under this section. ( e ) Small-volume manufacturers. Small-volume manufacturers meeting the eligibility requirements in \u00a7 86.1838 may delay complying with the requirements in this section until model year 2022. This also applies for continuing to use the E0 test fuel specified in \u00a7 86.113 through model year 2021. If meeting the Tier 3 standards would cause severe economic hardship, such manufacturers may ask us to approve an extended compliance deadline under the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.250 , except that the solvency criterion does not apply and there is no maximum duration of the hardship relief. [ 79 FR 23721 , Apr. 28, 2014, as amended at 80 FR 9108 , Feb. 19, 2015; 81 FR 73984 , Oct. 25, 2016; 89 FR 28168 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1818-12 Greenhouse gas emission standards for light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles. ( a ) Applicability. ( 1 ) The greenhouse gas standards and related requirements in this section apply to 2012 and later model year LDV, LDT, and MDPV, including multi-fuel vehicles, vehicles fueled with alternative fuels, hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles. Unless otherwise specified, multi-fuel vehicles must comply with all requirements established for each consumed fuel. ( 2 ) The standards specified in this section apply for testing at both low-altitude conditions and high-altitude conditions. However, manufacturers must submit an engineering evaluation indicating that common calibration approaches are utilized at high altitude instead of performing testing for certification, consistent with \u00a7 86.1829 . Any deviation from low altitude emission control practices must be included in the auxiliary emission control device (AECD) descriptions submitted at certification. Any AECD specific to high altitude requires engineering emission data for EPA evaluation to quantify any emission impact and determine the validity of the AECD. ( 3 ) A manufacturer that qualifies as a small business according to \u00a7 86.1801-12(j) is exempt from the emission standards in this section and the associated provisions in 40 CFR part 600 ; however, manufacturers may trade emission credits generated in a given model year only by certifying to emission standards that apply for that model year. Starting in model year 2027, manufacturers may produce no more than 500 exempt vehicles in any model year under this paragraph (a)(3) . This limit applies for vehicles with engines, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; this limit does not apply for electric vehicles. Vehicles that are not exempt under this paragraph (a)(3) must meet emission standards as specified in this section. ( 4 ) Emergency vehicles may be excluded from the emission standards described in this section. The manufacturer must notify the Administrator that they are making such an election in the model year reports required under 40 CFR 600.512-12 . Exclude such vehicles from both the calculation of the fleet average standard for a manufacturer under paragraph (c) of this section and from the calculation of the fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions in 40 CFR 600.510-12 . ( b ) Definitions. The following definitions apply for this section: ( 1 ) Passenger automobile means a motor vehicle that is a passenger automobile as that term is defined in 49 CFR 523.4 . ( 2 ) Light truck means a motor vehicle that is a non-passenger automobile as that term is defined in 49 CFR 523.5 . ( 3 ) Manufacturer has the meaning given by the Department of Transportation at 49 CFR 531.4 . ( c ) Fleet average CO 2 standards. Fleet average CO 2 standards apply as follows for passenger automobiles and light trucks: ( 1 ) Each manufacturer must comply with separate fleet average CO 2 standards for passenger automobiles and light trucks. To calculate the fleet average CO 2 standards for passenger automobiles for a given model year, multiply each CO 2 target value by the production volume of passenger automobiles for the corresponding model type-footprint combination, then sum those products and divide the sum by the total production volume of passenger automobiles in that model year. Repeat this calculation using production volumes of light trucks to determine the separate fleet average CO 2 standards for light trucks. Round the resulting fleet average CO 2 emission standards to the nearest whole gram per mile. Averaging calculations and other compliance provisions apply as described in \u00a7 86.1865 . ( 2 ) A CO 2 target value applies for each unique combination of model type and footprint. The CO 2 target serves as the emission standard that applies throughout the useful life for each vehicle. Determine the CO 2 target values from the following table for model year 2032 and later, or from paragraph (h) of this section for model year 2031 and earlier: Table 1 to Paragraph (c)(2) \u2014Footprint-Based CO 2 Target Values Vehicle type Footprint cutpoints (ft 2 ) CO 2 target value (g/mile) Low High Below low cutpoint Between cutpoints a Above high cutpoint Passenger automobile 45 56 71.8 0.35 \u00d7 f + 56.2 75.6 Light truck 45 70.0 75.7 1.38 \u00d7 f + 13.8 110.1 a Calculate the CO 2 target value for vehicles between the footprint cutpoints as shown, using vehicle footprint, f, and rounding the result to the nearest 0.1 g/mile. ( d ) In-use CO 2 exhaust emission standards. The in-use CO 2 exhaust emission standard shall be the combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emission value calculated for the appropriate vehicle carline/subconfiguration according to the provisions of \u00a7 600.113-12(g)(4) of this chapter adjusted by the deterioration factor from \u00a7 86.1823-08(m) . Multiply the result by 1.1 and round to the nearest whole gram per mile. For in-use vehicle carlines/subconfigurations for which a combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emission value was not determined under \u00a7 600.113-12(g)(4) of this chapter , the in-use CO 2 exhaust emission standard shall be the combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emission value calculated according to the provisions of \u00a7 600.208 of this chapter for the vehicle model type (except that total model year production data shall be used instead of sales projections) adjusted by the deterioration factor from \u00a7 86.1823-08(m) . Multiply the result by 1.1 and round to the nearest whole gram per mile. For vehicles that are capable of operating on multiple fuels, except plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, a separate in-use standard shall be determined for each fuel that the vehicle is capable of operating on. The standards in this paragraph (d) apply to in-use testing performed by the manufacturer pursuant to regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 86.1845 and 86.1846 and to in-use testing performed by EPA. ( e ) [Reserved] ( f ) Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4 ) exhaust emission standards for passenger automobiles and light trucks. Each manufacturer's fleet of combined passenger automobiles and light trucks must comply with N 2 O and CH 4 standards using either the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) , (2) , or (3) of this section. Except with prior EPA approval, a manufacturer may not use the provisions of both paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section in a model year. For example, a manufacturer may not use the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section for their passenger automobile fleet and the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) for their light truck fleet in the same model year. The manufacturer may use the provisions of both paragraphs (f)(1) and (3) of this section in a model year. For example, a manufacturer may meet the N 2 O standard in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and an alternative CH 4 standard determined under paragraph (f)(3) of this section. ( 1 ) Standards applicable to each test group. ( i ) Exhaust emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) shall not exceed 0.010 grams per mile at full useful life, as measured according to the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) described in subpart B of this part . Manufacturers may optionally determine an alternative N 2 O standard under paragraph (f)(3) of this section. ( ii ) Exhaust emissions of methane (CH 4 ) shall not exceed 0.030 grams per mile at full useful life, as measured according to the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) described in subpart B of this part . Manufacturers may optionally determine an alternative CH 4 standard under paragraph (f)(3) of this section. ( 2 ) Include N 2 O and CH 4 in fleet averaging program. Manufacturers may elect to not meet the emission standards in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Manufacturers making this election shall include N 2 O and CH 4 emissions in the determination of their fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions, as calculated in 40 CFR part 600, subpart F . Manufacturers using this option must include both N 2 O and CH 4 full useful life values in the fleet average calculations for passenger automobiles and light trucks. Use of this option will account for N 2 O and CH 4 emissions within the carbon-related exhaust emission value determined for each model type according to the provisions of 40 CFR part 600 . This option requires the determination of full useful life emission values for both the Federal Test Procedure and the Highway Fuel Economy Test. Manufacturers selecting this option are not required to demonstrate compliance with the standards in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. ( 3 ) Optional use of alternative N 2 O and/or CH 4 standards. Manufacturers may select an alternative standard applicable to a test group, for either N 2 O or CH 4 , or both. For example, a manufacturer may choose to meet the N 2 O standard in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and an alternative CH 4 standard in lieu of the standard in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section. The alternative standard for each pollutant must be greater than the applicable exhaust emission standard specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Alternative N 2 O and CH 4 standards apply to emissions measured according to the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) described in Subpart B of this part for the full useful life, and become the applicable certification and in-use emission standard(s) for the test group. Manufacturers using an alternative standard for N 2 O and/or CH 4 must calculate emission debits according to the provisions of paragraph (f)(4) of this section for each test group/alternative standard combination. Debits must be included in the calculation of total credits or debits generated in a model year as required under \u00a7 86.1865-12(k)(5) . For flexible fuel vehicles (or other vehicles certified for multiple fuels) you must meet these alternative standards when tested on any applicable test fuel type. ( 4 ) CO 2 -equivalent debits. CO 2 -equivalent debits for test groups using an alternative N 2 O and/or CH 4 standard as determined under paragraph (f)(3) of this section shall be calculated according to the following equation and rounded to the nearest whole megagram: Debits = [GWP \u00d7 (Production) \u00d7 (AltStd\u2014Std) \u00d7 VLM] \u00f7 1,000,000 Where: Debits = CO 2 -equivalent debits for N 2 O or CH 4 , in Megagrams, for a test group using an alternative N 2 O or CH 4 standard, rounded to the nearest whole Megagram; GWP = 25 if calculating CH 4 debits and 298 if calculating N 2 O debits; Production = The number of vehicles of that test group domestically produced plus those imported as defined in \u00a7 600.511 of this chapter ; AltStd = The alternative standard (N 2 O or CH 4 ) selected by the manufacturer under paragraph (f)(3) of this section; Std = The exhaust emission standard for N 2 O or CH 4 specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section; and VLM = 195,264 for passenger automobiles and 225,865 for light trucks. ( g ) Alternative fleet average standards for manufacturers with limited sales. Manufacturers meeting the criteria in this paragraph (g) may request alternative fleet average CO 2 standards for model year 2031 and earlier vehicles. ( 1 ) Eligibility for alternative standards. Eligibility as determined in this paragraph (g) shall be based on the total nationwide sales of combined passenger automobiles and light trucks. The terms \u201csales\u201d and \u201csold\u201d as used in this paragraph (g) shall mean vehicles produced for sale in the states and territories of the United States. For the purpose of determining eligibility the sales of related companies shall be aggregated according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1838-01(b)(3) , or, if a manufacturer has been granted operational independence status under \u00a7 86.1838-01(d) , eligibility shall be based on that manufacturer's vehicle sales. To be eligible for alternative standards established under this paragraph (g) , the manufacturer's average sales for the three most recent consecutive model years must remain below 5,000. If a manufacturer's average sales for the three most recent consecutive model years exceeds 4999, the manufacturer will no longer be eligible for exemption and must meet applicable emission standards starting with the model year according to the provisions in this paragraph (g)(1) . ( i ) If a manufacturer's average sales for three consecutive model years exceeds 4999, and if the increase in sales is the result of corporate acquisitions, mergers, or purchase by another manufacturer, the manufacturer shall comply with the emission standards described in paragraph (c) of this section, as applicable, beginning with the first model year after the last year of the three consecutive model years. ( ii ) If a manufacturer's average sales for three consecutive model years exceeds 4999 and is less than 50,000, and if the increase in sales is solely the result of the manufacturer's expansion in vehicle production (not the result of corporate acquisitions, mergers, or purchase by another manufacturer), the manufacturer shall comply with the emission standards described in paragraph (c) , of this section, as applicable, beginning with the second model year after the last year of the three consecutive model years. ( 2 ) Requirements for new entrants into the U.S. market. New entrants are those manufacturers without a prior record of automobile sales in the United States and without prior certification to greenhouse gas emission standards in this section. In addition to the eligibility requirements stated in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, new entrants must meet the following requirements: ( i ) In addition to the information required under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, new entrants must provide documentation that shows a clear intent by the company to actually enter the U.S. market in the years for which alternative standards are requested. Demonstrating such intent could include providing documentation that shows the establishment of a U.S. dealer network, documentation of work underway to meet other U.S. requirements ( e.g., safety standards), or other information that reasonably establishes intent to the satisfaction of the Administrator. ( ii ) Sales of vehicles in the U.S. by new entrants must remain below 5,000 vehicles for the first three model years in the U.S. market, and in subsequent years the average sales for any three consecutive years must remain below 5,000 vehicles. Vehicles sold in violation of these limits within the first five model years will be considered not covered by the certificate of conformity and the manufacturer will be subject to penalties on an individual-vehicle basis for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate. In addition, violation of these limits will result in loss of eligibility for alternative standards until such point as the manufacturer demonstrates two consecutive model years of sales below 5,000 automobiles. After the first five model years, the eligibility provisions in paragraph (g)(1) of this section apply, where violating the sales thresholds is no longer a violation of the condition on the certificate, but is instead grounds for losing eligibility for alternative standards. ( iii ) A manufacturer with sales in the most recent model year of less than 5,000 automobiles, but where prior model year sales were not less than 5,000 automobiles, is eligible to request alternative standards under this paragraph (g) . However, such a manufacturer will be considered a new entrant and subject to the provisions regarding new entrants in this paragraph (g) , except that the requirement to demonstrate an intent to enter the U.S. market in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section shall not apply. ( 3 ) How to request alternative fleet average standards. Eligible manufacturers may petition for alternative standards for up to five consecutive model years if sufficient information is available on which to base such standards. ( i ) To request alternative standards starting with the 2017 model year, eligible manufacturers must submit a completed application no later than July 30, 2013. ( ii ) To request alternative standards starting with a model year after 2017, eligible manufacturers must submit a completed request no later than 36 months prior to the start of the first model year to which the alternative standards would apply. ( iii ) The request must contain all the information required in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, and must be signed by a chief officer of the company. If the Administrator determines that the content of the request is incomplete or insufficient, the manufacturer will be notified and given an additional 30 days to amend the request. ( 4 ) Data and information submittal requirements. Eligible manufacturers requesting alternative standards under this paragraph (g) must submit the following information to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Administrator may request additional information as she deems appropriate. The completed request must be sent to the Environmental Protection Agency at the following address: Director, Compliance and Innovative Strategies Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2000 Traverwood Drive, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105. ( i ) Vehicle model and fleet information. ( A ) The model years to which the requested alternative standards would apply, limited to five consecutive model years. ( B ) Vehicle models and projections of sales volumes for each model year. ( C ) Detailed description of each model, including the vehicle type, vehicle mass, power, footprint, powertrain, and expected pricing. ( D ) The expected production cycle for each model, including new model introductions and redesign or refresh cycles. ( ii ) Technology evaluation information. ( A ) The CO 2 reduction technologies employed by the manufacturer on each vehicle model, or projected to be employed, including information regarding the cost and CO 2 -reducing effectiveness. Include technologies that improve air conditioning efficiency and reduce air conditioning system leakage, and any \u201coff-cycle\u201d technologies that potentially provide benefits outside the operation represented by the Federal Test Procedure and the Highway Fuel Economy Test. ( B ) An evaluation of comparable models from other manufacturers, including CO 2 results and air conditioning credits generated by the models. Comparable vehicles should be similar, but not necessarily identical, in the following respects: vehicle type, horsepower, mass, power-to-weight ratio, footprint, retail price, and any other relevant factors. For manufacturers requesting alternative standards starting with the 2017 model year, the analysis of comparable vehicles should include vehicles from the 2012 and 2013 model years, otherwise the analysis should at a minimum include vehicles from the most recent two model years. ( C ) A discussion of the CO 2 -reducing technologies employed on vehicles offered outside of the U.S. market but not available in the U.S., including a discussion as to why those vehicles and/or technologies are not being used to achieve CO 2 reductions for vehicles in the U.S. market. ( D ) An evaluation, at a minimum, of the technologies projected by the Environmental Protection Agency in a final rulemaking as those technologies likely to be used to meet greenhouse gas emission standards and the extent to which those technologies are employed or projected to be employed by the manufacturer. For any technology that is not projected to be fully employed, explain why this is the case. ( iii ) Alternative fleet average CO 2 standards. ( A ) The most stringent CO 2 level estimated to be feasible for each model, in each model year, and the technological basis for this estimate. ( B ) For each model year, a projection of the lowest feasible sales-weighted fleet average CO 2 value, separately for passenger automobiles and light trucks, and an explanation demonstrating that these projections are reasonable. ( C ) A copy of any application, data, and related information submitted to NHTSA in support of a request for alternative Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards filed under 49 CFR part 525 . ( iv ) Information supporting eligibility. ( A ) U.S. sales for the three previous model years and projected sales for the model years for which the manufacturer is seeking alternative standards. ( B ) Information regarding ownership relationships with other manufacturers, including details regarding the application of the provisions of \u00a7 86.1838-01(b)(3) regarding the aggregation of sales of related companies. ( 5 ) Alternative standards. Alternative standards apply as follows: ( i ) Where EPA has exercised its regulatory authority to administratively specify alternative standards, those alternative standards approved for model year 2021 continue to apply through model year 2026. Starting in model year 2027, manufacturers must certify to the standards in paragraph (h) of this section on a delayed schedule, as follows: In model year . . . Manufacturers must certify to the standards that would otherwise apply in . . . (A) 2027 2025 (B) 2028 2025 (C) 2029 2027 (D) 2030 2028 (E) 2031 2030 ( ii ) EPA may approve a request from other manufacturers for alternative fleet average CO 2 standards under this paragraph (g) . The alternative standards for those manufacturers will apply by model year as specified in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section. ( 6 ) Restrictions on credit trading. Manufacturers subject to alternative standards approved by the Administrator under this paragraph (g) may not trade credits to another manufacturer. Transfers between car and truck fleets within the manufacturer are allowed, and the carry-forward provisions for credits and deficits apply. Manufacturers may generate credits in a given model year for trading to another manufacturer by certifying to the standards in paragraph (h) of this section for the current model year across the manufacturer's full product line. A manufacturer certifying to the standards in paragraph (h) of this section will no longer be eligible to certify to the alternative standards under this paragraph (g) in later model years. ( 7 ) Starting in model year 2032, all manufacturers must certify to the standards in paragraph (c) of this section. ( h ) Historical and interim standards. The following CO 2 target values apply for model year 2031 and earlier vehicles: ( 1 ) CO 2 target values apply as follows for passenger automobiles: Table 2 to Paragraph ( h )(1)\u2014Historical and Interim CO 2 Target Values for Passenger Automobiles Model year Footprint cutpoints (ft 2 ) CO 2 target value (g/mile) Low High Below low cutpoint Between cutpoints a Above high cutpoint 2012 41 56 244.0 4.72 \u00d7 f + 50.5 315.0 2013 41 56 237.0 4.72 \u00d7 f + 43.3 307.0 2014 41 56 228.0 4.72 \u00d7 f + 34.8 299.0 2015 41 56 217.0 4.72 \u00d7 f + 23.4 288.0 2016 41 56 206.0 4.72 \u00d7 f + 12.7 277.0 2017 41 56 195.0 4.53 \u00d7 f + 8.9 263.0 2018 41 56 185.0 4.35 \u00d7 f + 6.5 250.0 2019 41 56 175.0 4.17 \u00d7 f + 4.2 238.0 2020 41 56 166.0 4.01 \u00d7 f + 1.9 226.0 2021 41 56 161.8 3.94 \u00d7 f + 0.2 220.9 2022 41 56 159.0 3.88 \u00d7 f \u20140.1 217.3 2023 41 56 145.6 3.56 \u00d7 f \u20140.4 199.1 2024 41 56 138.6 3.39 \u00d7 f \u20140.4 189.5 2025 41 56 130.5 3.26 \u00d7 f \u20143.2 179.4 2026 41 56 114.3 3.11 \u00d7 f \u201413.1 160.9 2027 42 56 135.9 0.66 \u00d7 f + 108.0 145.2 2028 43 56 123.8 0.60 \u00d7 f + 97.9 131.6 2029 44 56 110.6 0.54 \u00d7 f + 87.0 117.0 2030 45 56 98.2 0.47 \u00d7 f + 76.9 103.4 2031 45 56 85.3 0.41 \u00d7 f + 66.8 89.8 a Calculate the CO 2 target value for vehicles between the footprint cutpoints as shown, using vehicle footprint, f, and rounding the result to the nearest 0.1 g/mile.

[ 75 FR 25686 , May 7, 2010, as amended at 76 FR 19874 , Apr. 8, 2011; 76 FR 39521 , July 6, 2011; 76 FR 57377 , Sept. 15, 2011; 77 FR 63156 , Oct. 15, 2012; 79 FR 23725 , Apr. 28, 2014; 81 FR 73985 , Oct. 25, 2016; 85 FR 25268 , Apr. 30, 2020; 86 FR 34371 , June 29, 2021; 86 FR 74522 , Dec. 30, 2021; 89 FR 28168 , Apr. 18, 2024; 89 FR 50235 , June 13, 2024] \u00a7 86.1819-14 Greenhouse gas emission standards for medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. This section describes exhaust emission standards for CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O for medium-duty vehicles. The standards of this section apply for model year 2014 and later vehicles that are chassis-certified with respect to criteria pollutants under this subpart S. Additional medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles may be subject to the standards of this section as specified in paragraph (j) of this section. Any medium-duty or heavy-duty vehicles not subject to standards under this section are instead subject to greenhouse gas standards under 40 CFR part 1037 , and engines installed in these vehicles are subject to standards under 40 CFR part 1036 . If you are not the engine manufacturer, you must notify the engine manufacturer that its engines are subject to 40 CFR part 1036 if you intend to use their engines in vehicles that are not subject to standards under this section. Vehicles produced by small businesses may be exempted from the standards of this section as described in paragraph (k)(5) of this section. ( a ) Fleet-average CO 2 emission standards. Fleet-average CO 2 emission standards apply for the full useful life for each manufacturer as follows: ( 1 ) Calculate a work factor, WF, for each vehicle subconfiguration (or group of subconfigurations as allowed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section), rounded to the nearest pound, using the following equation: WF = 0.75 \u00d7 ( GVWR \u2212 Curb Weight + xwd ) + 0.25 \u00d7 ( GCWR \u2212 GVWR ) Where: xwd = 500 pounds if the vehicle has four-wheel drive or all-wheel drive; xwd = 0 pounds for all other vehicles. ( 2 ) CO 2 target values apply as described in this paragraph (a)(2) for model year 2032 and later. See paragraph (k)(4) of this section for model year 2031 and earlier: ( i ) For vehicles with work factor at or below 5,500 pounds, use the appropriate work factor in the following equation to calculate a target value for each vehicle subconfiguration (or group of subconfigurations as allowed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section), rounding to the nearest whole g/mile: CO 2 Target = 0.0221 \u00d7 WF + 170 ( ii ) For vehicles with work factor above 5,500 pounds, the CO 2 target value is 292 g/mile. ( 3 ) Calculate a production-weighted average of the target values and round it to the nearest whole g/mile. This is your fleet-average standard. All vehicles subject to the standards of this section form a single averaging set. Use the following equation to calculate your fleet-average standard from the target value for each vehicle subconfiguration ( Target i ) and U.S.-directed production volume of each vehicle subconfiguration for the given model year ( Volume i ): ( 4 ) You may group subconfigurations within a configuration together for purposes of calculating your fleet-average standard as follows: ( i ) You may group together subconfigurations that have the same equivalent test weight (ETW), GVWR, and GCWR. Calculate your work factor and target value assuming a curb weight equal to two times ETW minus GVWR. ( ii ) You may group together other subconfigurations if you use the lowest target value calculated for any of the subconfigurations. ( 5 ) The standards specified in this section apply for testing at both low-altitude conditions and high-altitude conditions. However, manufacturers must submit an engineering evaluation indicating that common calibration approaches are utilized at high altitude instead of performing testing for certification, consistent with \u00a7 86.1829 . Any deviation from low altitude emission control practices must be included in the auxiliary emission control device (AECD) descriptions submitted at certification. Any AECD specific to high altitude requires engineering emission data for EPA evaluation to quantify any emission impact and determine the validity of the AECD. ( b ) Production and in-use CO 2 standards. Each vehicle you produce that is subject to the standards of this section has an \u201cin-use\u201d CO 2 standard that is calculated from your test result and that applies for selective enforcement audits and in-use testing. This in-use CO 2 standard for each vehicle is equal to the applicable deteriorated emission level multiplied by 1.10 and rounded to the nearest whole g/mile. ( c ) N 2 O and CH 4 standards . Except as allowed under this paragraph (c) , all vehicles subject to the standards of this section must comply with an N 2 O standard of 0.05 g/mile and a CH 4 standard of 0.05 g/mile when calculated according to the provisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. You may specify CH 4 and/or N 2 O alternative standards using CO 2 emission credits instead of these otherwise applicable emission standards for one or more test groups. To do this, calculate the CH 4 and/or N 2 O emission credits needed (negative credits) using the equation in this paragraph (c) based on the FEL(s) you specify for your vehicles during certification. You must adjust the calculated emissions by the global warming potential ( GWP ): GWP equals 34 for CH 4 from model year 2021 and later vehicles, 25 for CH 4 from earlier vehicles, and 298 for N 2 O. This means, for example, that you must use 298 Mg of positive CO 2 credits to offset 1 Mg of negative N 2 O credits. Note that \u00a7 86.1818-12(f) does not apply for vehicles subject to the standards of this section. Calculate credits using the following equation, rounded to the nearest whole number: CO 2 Credits Needed (Mg) = [( FEL \u2212 Std ) \u00d7 ( U.S.-directed production volume ) \u00d7 ( Useful Life )] \u00d7 ( GWP ) \u00f7 1,000,000 ( d ) Compliance provisions. The following compliance provisions apply instead of other provisions described in this subpart S: ( 1 ) The CO 2 standards of this section apply with respect to CO 2 emissions, not with respect to carbon-related exhaust emissions (CREE). ( 2 ) The following general credit provisions apply: ( i ) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, credits you generate under this section may be used only to offset credit deficits under this section. You may bank credits for use in a future model year in which your average CO 2 level exceeds the standard. You may trade credits to another manufacturer according to \u00a7 86.1865-12(k)(8) . Before you bank or trade credits, you must apply any available credits to offset a deficit if the deadline to offset that credit deficit has not yet passed. ( ii ) Vehicles subject to the standards of this section are included in a single greenhouse gas averaging set separate from any averaging set otherwise included in this subpart S. ( iii ) Banked CO 2 credits keep their full value for five model years after the year in which they were generated. Unused credits may not be used for more than five model years after the model year in which the credits are generated. ( iv ) Credits generated under this section may be used to demonstrate to compliance with the CO 2 emission standards for vehicles certified under 40 CFR part 1037 as described in 40 CFR 1037.150(z) . ( 3 ) Special credit and incentive provisions related to air conditioning in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1867 and 86.1868 do not apply for vehicles subject to the standards of this section. ( 4 ) Measure emissions using the procedures of subpart B of this part and 40 CFR part 1066 . Determine separate emission results for the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) described in 40 CFR 1066.801(c)(1) and the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET) described in 40 CFR 1066.801(c)(3) . Calculate composite emission results from these two test cycles for demonstrating compliance with the CO 2 , N 2 O, and CH 4 standards based on a weighted average of the FTP (55%) and HFET (45%) emission results. Note that this differs from the way the criteria pollutant standards apply. ( 5 ) Apply an additive deterioration factor of zero to measured CO 2 emissions unless good engineering judgment indicates that emissions are likely to deteriorate in use. Use good engineering judgment to develop separate deterioration factors for N 2 O and CH 4 . ( 6 ) Credits are calculated using the useful life value (in miles) in place of \u201cvehicle lifetime miles\u201d as specified in \u00a7 86.1865 . Calculate a total credit or debit balance in a model year by adding credits and debits from \u00a7 86.1865-12(k)(4) , subtracting any CO 2 -equivalent debits for N 2 O or CH 4 calculated according to paragraph (c) of this section, and adding any of the following credits: ( i ) Off-cycle technology credits according to paragraph (d)(13) of this section. ( ii ) Early credits from vehicles certified under paragraph (k)(2) of this section. ( iii ) Advanced-technology credits according to paragraph (k)(7) of this section. ( 7 ) [Reserved] ( 8 ) The provisions of \u00a7 86.1818 do not apply. ( 9 ) Calculate your fleet-average emission rate consistent with good engineering judgment and the provisions of \u00a7 86.1865 . The following additional provisions apply: ( i ) Unless we approve a lower number, you must test at least ten subconfigurations. If you produce more than 100 subconfigurations in a given model year, you must test at least ten percent of your subconfigurations. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(9)(i) , count carryover tests, but do not include analytically derived CO 2 emission rates, data substitutions, or other untested allowances. We may approve a lower number of tests for manufacturers that have limited product offerings, or low sales volumes. Note that good engineering judgment and other provisions of this part may require you to test more subconfigurations than these minimum values. ( ii ) The provisions of paragraph (g) of this section specify how you may use analytically derived CO 2 emission rates. ( iii ) At least 90 percent of final production volume at the configuration level must be represented by test data (real, data substituted, or analytical). ( iv ) Perform fleet-average CO 2 calculations as described in \u00a7 86.1865 and 40 CFR part 600 , with the following exceptions: ( A ) Use CO 2 emissions values for all test results, intermediate calculations, and fleet average calculations instead of the carbon-related exhaust emission (CREE) values specified in this subpart S and 40 CFR part 600 . ( B ) Perform intermediate CO 2 calculations for subconfigurations within each configuration using the subconfiguration and configuration definitions in paragraph (d)(12) of this section. ( C ) Perform intermediate CO 2 calculations for configurations within each test group and transmission type (instead of configurations within each base level and base levels within each model type). Use the configuration definition in paragraph (d)(12)(i) of this section. ( D ) Do not perform intermediate CO 2 calculations for each base level or for each model type. Base level and model type CO 2 calculations are not applicable to heavy-duty vehicles subject to standards in this section. ( E ) Determine fleet average CO 2 emissions for heavy-duty vehicles subject to standards in this section as described in 40 CFR 600.510-12(j) , except that the calculations must be performed on the basis of test group and transmission type (instead of the model-type basis specified in the light-duty vehicle regulations), and the calculations for dual-fuel, multi-fuel, and flexible-fuel vehicles must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section. ( 10 ) For dual-fuel, multi-fuel, and flexible-fuel vehicles, perform exhaust testing on each fuel type (for example, gasoline and E85). ( i ) Use either the conventional-fueled CO 2 emission rate or a weighted average of your emission results as specified in 40 CFR 600.510-12(k) for light-duty trucks. ( ii ) If you certify to an alternate standard for N 2 O or CH 4 emissions, you may not exceed the alternate standard when tested on either fuel. ( 11 ) Test your vehicles with an equivalent test weight based on its Adjusted Loaded Vehicle Weight (ALVW). Determine equivalent test weight from the ALVW as specified in 40 CFR 1066.805 ; round ALVW values above 14,000 pounds to the nearest 500 pound increment. ( 12 ) The following definitions apply for the purposes of this section: ( i ) Configuration means a subclassification within a test group based on engine code, transmission type and gear ratios, final drive ratio, and other parameters we designate. Engine code means the combination of both \u201cengine code\u201d and \u201cbasic engine\u201d as defined for light-duty vehicles in 40 CFR 600.002 . ( ii ) Subconfiguration means a unique combination within a vehicle configuration (as defined in this paragraph (d)(12) ) of equivalent test weight, road-load horsepower, and any other operational characteristics or parameters that we determine may significantly affect CO 2 emissions within a vehicle configuration. Note that for vehicles subject to standards of this section, equivalent test weight (ETW) is based on the ALVW of the vehicle as outlined in paragraph (d)(11) of this section. ( 13 ) This paragraph (d)(13) applies for CO 2 reductions resulting from technologies that were not in common use before 2010 that are not reflected in the specified test procedures. While you are not required to prove that such technologies were not in common use with heavy-duty vehicles before model year 2010, we will not approve your request if we determine they do not qualify. These may be described as off-cycle or innovative technologies. We may allow you to generate emission credits consistent with the provisions of \u00a7 86.1869-12(c) and (d) , but only through model year 2026. The 5-cycle methodology is not presumed to be preferred over alternative methodologies described in \u00a7 86.1869-12(d) . ( 14 ) You must submit pre-model year reports before you submit your applications for certification for a given model year. Unless we specify otherwise, include the information specified for pre-model year reports in 49 CFR 535.8 . ( 15 ) You must submit a final report within 90 days after the end of the model year. Unless we specify otherwise, include applicable information identified in \u00a7 86.1865-12(l) , 40 CFR 600.512 , and 49 CFR 535.8(e) . The final report must include at least the following information: ( i ) Model year. ( ii ) Applicable fleet average CO 2 standard. ( iii ) Calculated fleet average CO 2 value and all the values required to calculate the CO 2 value. ( iv ) Number of credits or debits incurred and all values required to calculate those values. ( v ) Resulting balance of credits or debits. ( vi ) N 2 O emissions. ( vii ) CH 4 emissions. ( viii ) Total and percent leakage rates under paragraph (h) of this section (through model year 2026 only). ( 16 ) You may apply the provisions for delegated assembly as described in 40 CFR 1037.621 . ( 17 ) You may calculate emission rates for weight increments less than the 500-pound increment specified for test weight. This does not change the applicable test weights. ( i ) Use the ADC equation in paragraph (g) of this section to adjust your emission rates for vehicles in increments of 50, 100, or 250 pounds instead of the 500 pound test-weight increments. Adjust emissions to the midpoint of each increment. This is the equivalent emission weight. For example, vehicles with a test weight basis of 11,751 to 12,250 pounds (which have an equivalent test weight of 12,000 pounds) could be regrouped into 100-pound increments as follows: Table 1 to paragraph ( d )(17)(i)\u2014Example of Test-Weight Groupings Test weight basis Equivalent emission weight Equivalent test weight 11,751-11,850 11,800 12,000 11,851-11,950 11,900 12,000 11,951-12,050 12,000 12,000 12,051-12,150 12,100 12,000 12,151-12,250 12,200 12,000 ( ii ) You must use the same increment for all equivalent test weight classes across your whole product line in a given model year. You must also specify curb weight for calculating the work factor in a way that is consistent with your approach for determining test weight for calculating ADCs under this paragraph (d)(17) . ( e ) Useful life. The exhaust emission standards of this section apply for the full useful life, as described in \u00a7 86.1805 . ( f ) [Reserved] ( g ) Analytically derived CO 2 emission rates (ADCs). This paragraph (g) describes an allowance to use estimated ( i.e., analytically derived) CO 2 emission rates based on baseline test data instead of measured emission rates for calculating fleet-average emissions. Note that these ADCs are similar to ADFEs used for light-duty vehicles. Note also that F terms used in this paragraph (g) represent coefficients from the following road load equation: Force = F 0 + F 1 \u00b7 ( velocity ) + F 2 \u00b7 ( velocity ) 2 ( 1 ) Except as specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, use the following equation to calculate the ADC of a new vehicle from road load force coefficients ( F 0, F 1, F 2), axle ratio, and test weight: ADC = CO 2 base + 2.18 \u00b7 \u0394 F 0 + 37.4 \u00b7 \u0394 F 1 + 2257 \u00b7 \u0394 F 2 + 189 \u00b7 \u0394 AR + 0.0222\u00b7 \u0394 ETW Where: ADC = Analytically derived combined city/highway CO 2 emission rate (g/mile) for a new vehicle. CO 2base = Combined city/highway CO 2 emission rate (g/mile) of a baseline vehicle. \u0394 F 0 = F 0 of the new vehicle\u2212 F 0 of the baseline vehicle. \u0394 F 1 = F 1 of the new vehicle\u2212 F 1 of the baseline vehicle. \u0394 F 2 = F 2 of the new vehicle\u2212 F 2 of the baseline vehicle. \u0394 AR = Axle ratio of the new vehicle\u2212axle ratio of the baseline vehicle. \u0394 ETW = ETW of the new vehicle\u2212 ETW of the baseline vehicle. ( 2 ) The purpose of this section is to accurately estimate CO 2 emission rates. ( i ) You must apply the provisions of this section consistent with good engineering judgment. For example, do not use the equation in paragraph (g)(1) of this section where good engineering judgment indicates that it will not accurately estimate emissions. You may ask us to approve alternate equations that allow you to estimate emissions more accurately. ( ii ) The analytically derived CO 2 equation in paragraph (g)(1) of this section may be periodically updated through publication of an EPA guidance document to more accurately characterize CO 2 emission levels for example, changes may be appropriate based on new test data, future technology changes, or to changes in future CO 2 emission levels. Any EPA guidance document will determine the model year that the updated equation takes effect. We will issue guidance no later than eight months before the effective model year. For example, model year 2014 may start January 2, 2013, so guidance for model year 2014 would be issued by May 1, 2012. ( 3 ) You may select baseline test data without our advance approval if they meet all the following criteria: ( i ) Vehicles considered for the baseline test must comply with all applicable emission standards in the model year associated with the ADC. ( ii ) You must include in the pool of tests considered for baseline selection all official tests of the same or equivalent basic engine, transmission class, engine code, transmission code, engine horsepower, dynamometer drive wheels, and compression ratio as the ADC subconfiguration. Do not include tests in which emissions exceed any applicable standard. ( iii ) Where necessary to minimize the CO 2 adjustment, you may supplement the pool with tests associated with worst-case engine or transmission codes and carryover or carry-across test groups. If you do, all the data that qualify for inclusion using the elected worst-case substitution (or carryover or carry-across) must be included in the pool as supplemental data ( i.e., individual test vehicles may not be selected for inclusion). You must also include the supplemental data in all subsequent pools, where applicable. ( iv ) Tests previously used during the subject model year as baseline tests in ten other ADC subconfigurations must be eliminated from the pool. ( v ) Select the tested subconfiguration with the smallest absolute difference between the ADC and the test CO 2 emission rate for combined emissions. Use this as the baseline test for the target ADC subconfiguration. ( 4 ) You may ask us to allow you to use baseline test data not fully meeting the provisions of paragraph (g)(3) of this section. ( 5 ) Calculate the ADC rounded to the nearest whole g/mile. Except with our advance approval, the downward adjustment of ADC from the baseline is limited to ADC values 20 percent below the baseline emission rate. The upward adjustment is not limited. ( 6 ) You may not submit an ADC if an actual test has been run on the target subconfiguration during the certification process or on a development vehicle that is eligible to be declared as an emission-data vehicle. ( 7 ) No more than 40 percent of the subconfigurations tested in your final CO 2 submission may be represented by ADCs. ( 8 ) Keep the following records for at least five years, and show them to us if we ask to see them: ( i ) The pool of tests. ( ii ) The vehicle description and tests chosen as the baseline and the basis for the selection. ( iii ) The target ADC subconfiguration. ( iv ) The calculated emission rates. ( 9 ) We may perform or order a confirmatory test of any subconfiguration covered by an ADC. ( 10 ) Where we determine that you did not fully comply with the provisions of this paragraph (g) , we may require that you comply based on actual test data and that you recalculate your fleet-average emission rate. ( h ) Air conditioning leakage. Loss of refrigerant from your air conditioning systems may not exceed a total leakage rate of 11.0 grams per year or a percent leakage rate of 1.50 percent per year, whichever is greater. This applies for all refrigerants. Calculate the annual rate of refrigerant leakage according to the procedures specified in SAE J2727 SEP2023 (incorporated by reference, see \u00a7 86.1 ) or as specified in \u00a7 86.1867-12(a) . Calculate the percent leakage rate as: [total leakage rate (g/yr)] \u00f7 [total refrigerant capacity (g)] \u00d7 100. Round your percent leakage rate to the nearest one-hundredth of a percent. For purpose of this requirement, \u201crefrigerant capacity\u201d is the total mass of refrigerant recommended by the vehicle manufacturer as representing a full charge. Where full charge is specified as a pressure, use good engineering judgment to convert the pressure and system volume to a mass. ( i ) [Reserved] ( j ) GHG certification of additional vehicles under this subpart. You may certify certain complete or cab-complete vehicles to the GHG standards of this section. Certain high-GCWR vehicles may also be subject to the GHG standards of this section. All vehicles optionally certified under this paragraph (j) are deemed to be subject to the GHG standards of this section. Note that for vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR and at or below 26,000 pounds GVWR, GHG certification under this paragraph (j) does not affect how you may or may not certify with respect to criteria pollutants. ( 1 ) For GHG compliance, you may certify any complete or cab-complete spark-ignition vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR and at or below 26,000 pounds GVWR to the GHG standards of this section even though this section otherwise specifies that you may certify vehicles to the GHG standards of this section only if they are chassis-certified for criteria pollutants. This paragraph (j)(1) also applies for vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR with GCWR above 22,000 pounds with installed engines that have been certified under 40 CFR part 1036 as described in 40 CFR 1036.635 . ( 2 ) You may apply the provisions of this section to cab-complete vehicles based on a complete sister vehicle. In unusual circumstances, you may ask us to apply these provisions to Class 2b or Class 3 incomplete vehicles that do not meet the definition of cab-complete. ( i ) Except as specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section, for purposes of this section, a complete sister vehicle is a complete vehicle of the same vehicle configuration as the cab-complete vehicle. You may not apply the provisions of this paragraph (j) to any vehicle configuration that has a four-wheel rear axle if the complete sister vehicle has a two-wheel rear axle. ( ii ) Calculate the target value for fleet average CO 2 emissions under paragraph (a) or (k)(4) of this section based on the work factor value that applies for the complete sister vehicle. ( iii ) Test these cab-complete vehicles using the same equivalent test weight and other dynamometer settings that apply for the complete vehicle from which you used the work factor value (the complete sister vehicle). For GHG certification, you may submit the test data from that complete sister vehicle instead of performing the test on the cab-complete vehicle. ( iv ) You are not required to produce the complete sister vehicle for sale to use the provisions of this paragraph (j)(2) . This means the complete sister vehicle may be a carryover vehicle from a prior model year or a vehicle created solely for the purpose of testing. ( 3 ) For GHG purposes, if a cab-complete vehicle is not of the same vehicle configuration as a complete sister vehicle due only to certain factors unrelated to coastdown performance, you may use the road-load coefficients from the complete sister vehicle for certification testing of the cab-complete vehicle, but you may not use emission data from the complete sister vehicle for certifying the cab-complete vehicle. ( 4 ) The GHG standards of this section and related provisions apply for vehicles above 22,000 pounds GCWR as described in 40 CFR 1036.635 . ( k ) Interim provisions. The following provisions apply instead of other provisions in this subpart: ( 1 ) Incentives for early introduction. Manufacturers may voluntarily certify in model year 2013 (or earlier model years for electric vehicles) to the greenhouse gas standards that apply starting in model year 2014 as specified in 40 CFR 1037.150(a) . ( 2 ) Early credits. To generate early credits under this paragraph (k)(2) for any vehicles other than electric vehicles, you must certify your entire U.S.-directed fleet to these standards. If you calculate a separate fleet average for advanced-technology vehicles under paragraph (k)(7) of this section, you must certify your entire U.S.-directed production volume of both advanced and conventional vehicles within the fleet. If some test groups are certified after the start of the model year, you may generate credits only for production that occurs after all test groups are certified. For example, if you produce three test groups in an averaging set and you receive your certificates for those test groups on January 4, 2013, March 15, 2013, and April 24, 2013, you may not generate credits for model year 2013 for vehicles from any of the test groups produced before April 24, 2013. Calculate credits relative to the standard that would apply in model year 2014 using the applicable equations in this subpart and your model year 2013 U.S.-directed production volumes. These credits may be used to show compliance with the standards of this subpart for 2014 and later model years. We recommend that you notify us of your intent to use this provision before submitting your applications. ( 3 ) Compliance date. Compliance with the standards of this section was optional before January 1, 2014 as specified in 40 CFR 1037.150(g) . ( 4 ) Historical and interim standards. The following CO 2 target values apply for model year 2031 and earlier vehicles: ( i ) CO 2 target values apply as follows for model years 2014 through 2027, except as specified in paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section: Table 2 to paragraph ( k )(4)(i)\u2014CO 2 Target Values for Model years 2014 Through 2027 Model year CO 2 target (g/mile) a Spark-ignition Compression-ignition 2014 0.0482 \u00d7 WF + 371 0.0478 \u00d7 WF + 368. 2015 0.0479 \u00d7 WF + 369 0.0474 \u00d7 WF + 366. 2016 0.0469 \u00d7 WF + 362 0.0460 \u00d7 WF + 354. 2017 0.0460 \u00d7 WF + 354 0.0445 \u00d7 WF + 343. 2018-2020 0.0440 \u00d7 WF + 339 0.0416 \u00d7 WF + 320. 2021 0.0429 \u00d7 WF + 331 0.0406 \u00d7 WF + 312. 2022 0.0418 \u00d7 WF + 322 0.0395 \u00d7 WF + 304. 2023 0.0408 \u00d7 WF + 314 0.0386 \u00d7 WF + 297. 2024 0.0398 \u00d7 WF + 306 0.0376 \u00d7 WF + 289. 2025 0.0388 \u00d7 WF + 299 0.0367 \u00d7 WF + 282. 2026 0.0378 \u00d7 WF + 291 0.0357 \u00d7 WF + 275. 2027 0.0348 \u00d7 WF + 268 0.0348 \u00d7 WF + 268. a Electric vehicles are subject to the compression-ignition CO 2 target values.

Standards apply on a delayed schedule for manufacturers meeting the small business criteria specified in 13 CFR 121.201 (NAICS code 336111); the employee and revenue limits apply to the total number employees and total revenue together for affiliated companies. Qualifying small manufacturers are not subject to the greenhouse gas standards of this section for vehicles with a date of manufacture before January 1, 2022, as specified in 40 CFR 1037.150(c) . In addition, small manufacturers producing vehicles that run on any fuel other than gasoline, E85, or diesel fuel may delay complying with every later standard under this part by one model year through model year 2026. The following provisions apply starting with model year 2027: ( i ) Qualifying small manufacturers remain subject to the model year 2026 greenhouse gas standards; however, small manufacturers may trade emission credits generated in a given model year only by certifying to standards that apply for that model year. ( ii ) Small manufacturers may produce no more than 500 exempt vehicles in any model year under paragraph (k)(5)(i) of this section. This limit applies for vehicles with engines, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; this limit does not apply for electric vehicles. Vehicles that are not exempt under this paragraph (k)(5) must meet emission standards as specified in this section. ( 6 ) Alternate N 2 O standards. Manufacturers may show compliance with the N 2 O standards using an engineering analysis. This allowance also applies for model year 2015 and later test groups carried over from model 2014 consistent with the provisions of \u00a7 86.1839 . You may not certify to an N 2 O FEL different than the standard without measuring N 2 O emissions. ( 7 ) Advanced-technology credits. Provisions for advanced-technology credits apply as described in 40 CFR 1037.615 . If you generate credits from Phase 1 vehicles certified with advanced technology (in model years 2014 through 2020), you may multiply these credits by 1.50. If you generate credits from model year 2021 through 2026 vehicles certified with advanced technology, you may multiply these credits by 3.5 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, 4.5 for battery electric vehicles, and 5.5 for fuel cell vehicles. Advanced-technology credits from Phase 1 vehicles may be used to show compliance with any standards of this part or 40 CFR part 1036 or part 1037, subject to the restrictions in 40 CFR 1037.740 . Similarly, you may use up to 60,000 Mg per year of advanced-technology credits generated under 40 CFR 1036.615 or 1037.615 (from Phase 1 vehicles) to demonstrate compliance with the CO 2 standards in this section. Include vehicles generating credits in separate fleet average calculations (and exclude them from your conventional fleet average calculation). You must first apply these advanced-technology vehicle credits to any deficits for other vehicles in the averaging set before applying them to other averaging sets. The provisions of this paragraph (k)(7) do not apply for credits generated from model year 2027 and later vehicles. ( 8 ) Loose engine sales. This paragraph (k)(8) applies for model year 2023 and earlier spark-ignition engines with identical hardware compared with engines used in vehicles certified to the standards of this section, where you sell such engines as loose engines or as engines installed in incomplete vehicles that are not cab-complete vehicles. You may include such engines in a test group certified to the standards of this section, subject to the following provisions: ( i ) Engines certified under this paragraph (k)(8) are deemed to be certified to the standards of 40 CFR 1036.108 as specified in 40 CFR 1036.150(j) . ( ii ) For 2020 and earlier model years, the maximum allowable U.S.-directed production volume of engines you sell under this paragraph (k)(8) in any given model year is ten percent of the total U.S-directed production volume of engines of that design that you produce for heavy-duty applications for that model year, including engines you produce for complete vehicles, cab-complete vehicles, and other incomplete vehicles. The total number of engines you may certify under this paragraph (k)(8) , of all engine designs, may not exceed 15,000 in any model year. Engines produced in excess of either of these limits are not covered by your certificate. For example, if you produce 80,000 complete model year 2017 Class 2b pickup trucks with a certain engine and 10,000 incomplete model year 2017 Class 3 vehicles with that same engine, and you do not apply the provisions of this paragraph (k)(8) to any other engine designs, you may produce up to 10,000 engines of that design for sale as loose engines under this paragraph (k)(8) . If you produced 11,000 engines of that design for sale as loose engines, the last 1,000 of them that you produced in that model year 2017 would be considered uncertified. ( iii ) For model years 2021 through 2023, the U.S.-directed production volume of engines you sell under this paragraph (k)(8) in any given model year may not exceed 10,000 units. ( iv ) This paragraph (k)(8) does not apply for engines certified to the standards of 40 CFR 1036.108 . ( v ) Label the engines as specified in 40 CFR 1036.135 including the following compliance statement: \u201cTHIS ENGINE WAS CERTIFIED TO THE ALTERNATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION STANDARDS OF 40 CFR 1036.150(j) .\u201d List the test group name instead of an engine family name. ( vi ) Vehicles using engines certified under this paragraph (k)(8) are subject to the emission standards of 40 CFR 1037.105 . ( vii ) For certification purposes, your engines are deemed to have a CO 2 target value and test result equal to the CO 2 target value and test result for the complete vehicle in the applicable test group with the highest equivalent test weight, except as specified in paragraph (k)(8)(vii)(B) of this section. Use these values to calculate your target value, fleet average emission rate, and in-use emission standard. Where there are multiple complete vehicles with the same highest equivalent test weight, select the CO 2 target value and test result as follows: ( A ) If one or more of the CO 2 test results exceed the applicable target value, use the CO 2 target value and test result of the vehicle that exceeds its target value by the greatest amount. ( B ) If none of the CO 2 test results exceed the applicable target value, select the highest target value and set the test result equal to it. This means that you may not generate emission credits from vehicles certified under this paragraph (k)(8) . ( viii ) Production and in-use CO 2 standards apply as described in paragraph (b) of this section. ( ix ) N 2 O and CH 4 standards apply as described in paragraph (c) of this section. ( x ) State in your applications for certification that your test group and engine family will include engines certified under this paragraph (k)(8) . This applies for your greenhouse gas vehicle test group and your criteria pollutant engine family. List in each application the name of the corresponding test group/engine family. ( 9 ) Credit adjustment for useful life. For credits that you calculate based on a useful life of 120,000 miles, multiply any banked credits that you carry forward for use in model year 2021 and later by 1.25. ( 10 ) CO 2 rounding. For model year 2014 and earlier vehicles, you may round measured and calculated CO 2 emission levels to the nearest 0.1 g/mile, instead of the nearest whole g/mile as specified in paragraphs (a) , (b) , and (g) of this section. [ 81 FR 73895 , Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 88 FR 4479 , Jan. 24, 2023; 89 FR 28172 , Apr. 18, 2024; 89 FR 29738 , Apr. 22, 2024] \u00a7 86.1820-01 Durability group determination. This section applies to the grouping of vehicles into durability groups. Manufacturers shall divide their product line into durability groups based on the following criteria: ( a ) The vehicles covered by a certification application shall be divided into groups of vehicles which are expected to have similar emission deterioration and emission component durability characteristics throughout their useful life. Manufacturers shall use good engineering judgment in dividing their vehicles into durability groups. Such groups of vehicles are defined as durability groups. ( b ) To be included in the same durability group, vehicles must be identical in all the respects listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section and meet one of the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(8) of this section: ( 1 ) Combustion cycle (e.g., two stroke, four stroke, Otto cycle, diesel cycle). ( 2 ) Engine type (e.g., piston, rotary, turbine, air cooled versus water cooled). ( 3 ) Fuel used (e.g., gasoline, diesel, methanol, ethanol, CNG, LPG, flexible fuels). ( 4 ) Basic fuel metering system (e.g., throttle body injection, port injection (including central port injection), carburetor, CNG mixer unit). ( 5 ) Catalyst construction (for example, beads or monolith). ( 6 ) Precious metal composition of the catalyst by the type of principal active material(s) used (e.g., platinum based oxidation catalyst, palladium based oxidation catalyst, platinum and rhodium three-way catalyst, palladium and rhodium three way catalyst, platinum and palladium and rhodium three way catalyst). ( 7 ) Type of particulate filter (none, catalyzed, noncatalyzed). ( 8 ) The manufacturer must choose one of the following two criteria: ( i ) Grouping statistic: ( A ) Vehicles are grouped based upon the value of the grouping statistic determined using the following equation: Where: GS = Grouping Statistic used to evaluate the range of precious metal loading rates and relative sizing of the catalysts compared to the engine displacement that are allowable within a durability group. The grouping statistic shall be rounded to a tenth of a gram/liter. Cat Vol = Total volume of the catalyst(s) in liters. Include the volume of any catalyzed particulate filters. Disp = Displacement of the engine in liters. Loading rate = The mass of total precious metal(s) in the catalyst (or the total mass of all precious metal(s) of all the catalysts if the vehicle is equipped with multiple catalysts) in grams divided by the total volume of the catalyst(s) in liters. Include the mass of precious metals in any catalyzed particulate filters. ( B ) Engine-emission control system combinations which have a grouping statistic which is either less than 25 percent of the largest grouping statistic value, or less than 0.2 g/liter (whichever allows the greater coverage of the durability group) shall be grouped into the same durability group. ( ii ) The manufacturer may elect to use another procedure which results in at least as many durability groups as required using criteria in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section providing that only vehicles with similar emission deterioration or durability are combined into a single durability group. ( c ) Where vehicles are of a type which cannot be divided into durability groups based on the criteria listed above (such as non-catalyst control system approaches), the Administrator will establish durability groups for those vehicles based upon the features most related to their exhaust emission deterioration characteristics. ( d ) Manufacturers may further divide groups determined under paragraph (b) of this section provided the Administrator is notified of any such changes prior to or concurrently with the submission of the application for certification (preferably at an annual preview meeting scheduled before the manufacturer begins certification activities for the model year). ( e ) Manufacturers may request the Administrator's approval to combine vehicles into a single durability group which would normally not be eligible to be in a single durability group. The petition should provide: ( 1 ) Substantial evidence that all the vehicles in the larger grouping will have the same degree of emission deterioration; ( 2 ) Evidence of equivalent component durability over the vehicle's useful life; and ( 3 ) Evidence that the groups will result in sufficient In-Use Verification Program data, appropriate tracking in use, and clear liability for the Agency's recall program. [ 64 FR 23925 , May 4, 1999, as amended at 81 FR 73991 , Oct. 25, 2016; 89 FR 28175 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1821-01 Evaporative/refueling family determination. ( a ) The gasoline-, ethanol-, metha-nol-, liquefied petroleum gas-, and natural gas-fueled vehicles described in a certification application will be divided into groupings expected to have similar evaporative and/or refueling emission characteristics (as applicable) throughout their useful life. Each group of vehicles with similar evaporative and/or refueling emission characteristics shall be defined as a separate evaporative/refueling family. Manufacturers shall use good engineering judgment to determine evaporative/refueling families. This section applies for all sizes and types of vehicles that are subject to evaporative or refueling standards, including those subject to standards under 40 CFR 1037.103 . ( b ) For vehicles that operate on volatile liquid fuels to be classed in the same evaporative/refueling family, they must be similar with respect to all the following items: ( 1 ) Type of vapor storage device (e.g., canister, air cleaner, crankcase). ( 2 ) Basic canister design. ( i ) Working capacity\u2014grams adsorption within a 10 g. range. ( ii ) System configuration\u2014number of canisters and method of connection (i.e., series, parallel). ( iii ) Canister geometry, construction and materials. ( 3 ) Fuel system. ( 4 ) Type of refueling emission control system\u2014non-integrated or integrated with the evaporative control system. Further, if the system is non-integrated, whether or not any other evaporative emissions, e.g. diurnal or hot soak emissions, are captured in the same storage device as the refueling emissions. ( 5 ) Fillpipe seal mechanism\u2014mechanical, liquid trap, other. ( 6 ) Vapor control system or method of controlling vapor flow through the vapor line to the canister (for example, type of valve, vapor control strategy). ( 7 ) Purge control system (for example, type of valve, purge control strategy). ( 8 ) Vapor hose material. ( 9 ) Fuel tank material. ( 10 ) Evaporative emission standard or family emission limit (FEL) for testing at low-altitude conditions. ( c ) Where vehicles are of a type which cannot be divided into evaporative/refueling families based on the criteria listed above (such as non-canister control system approaches), the Administrator will establish families for those vehicles based upon the features most related to their evaporative and/or refueling emission characteristics. ( d ) Manufacturers may further divide families determined under paragraph (b) of this section provided the Administrator is notified of any such changes prior to or concurrently with the submission of the application for certification (preferably at an annual preview meeting scheduled before the manufacturer begins certification activities for the model year). ( e ) Manufacturers may petition the Administrator to combine vehicles into a single evaporative/refueling family which would normally not be eligible to be in a single evaporative/refueling family. The petition should provide: ( 1 ) Substantial evidence that all the vehicles in the larger grouping will have the same degree of evaporative emission deterioration; ( 2 ) Evidence of equivalent component durability over the vehicle's useful life; and ( 3 ) Evidence that the groups will result in sufficient In-Use Verification Program data, appropriate tracking in use, and clear liability for the Agency's recall program. ( f ) For vehicles to be classed in the same leak family, they must be similar with respect to the items listed in paragraph (b) of this section and use the same OBD method for detecting leaks. ( g ) Determine evaporative/refueling families separately for vehicles subject to standards under 40 CFR 1037.103 based on the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, even for vehicles you certify based on engineering analysis under 40 CFR 1037.103(c) . In addition, if you certify such vehicles based on testing, include only those vehicle models in the family that are properly represented by that testing, as described in \u00a7 86.1828 . [ 64 FR 23925 , May 4, 1999, as amended at 79 FR 23725 , Apr. 28, 2014; 88 FR 4479 , Jan. 24, 2023; 89 FR 28176 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1822-01 Durability data vehicle selection. ( a ) Within each durability group, the vehicle configuration which is expected to generate the highest level of exhaust emission deterioration on candidate vehicles in use, considering all constituents, shall be selected as the durability data vehicle configuration. The manufacturer will use good engineering judgment in making this selection. ( b ) The manufacturer may select, using good engineering judgment, an equivalent or worst-case configuration in lieu of testing the vehicle selected in paragraph (a) of this section. Carryover data satisfying the provisions of \u00a7 86.1839-01 may also be used in lieu of testing the configuration selected in paragraph (a) of this section. \u00a7 86.1823-08 Durability demonstration procedures for exhaust emissions. This section describes durability demonstration procedures for exhaust emissions. Eligible small-volume manufacturers or small-volume test groups may optionally meet the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 86.1826 and 86.1838 instead of the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (m) of this section. A separate durability demonstration is required for each durability group. ( a ) Durability program objective. The durability program must predict an expected in-use emission deterioration rate and emission level that effectively represents a significant majority of the distribution of emission levels and deterioration in actual use over the full and intermediate useful life of candidate in-use vehicles of each vehicle design which uses the durability program. ( b ) Required durability demonstration. Manufacturers must conduct a durability demonstration for each durability group using a procedure specified in either paragraph (c) , (d) , or (e) of this section. ( c ) Standard whole-vehicle durability procedure. This procedure consists of conducting mileage accumulation and periodic testing on the durability data vehicle, selected under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1822 described as follows: ( 1 ) Mileage accumulation must be conducted using the standard road cycle (SRC). The SRC is described in appendix V of this part . ( i ) Mileage accumulation on the SRC may be conducted on a track or on a chassis mileage accumulation dynamometer. Alternatively, the entire engine and emission control system may be aged on an engine dynamometer using methods that will replicate the aging that occurs on the road for that vehicle following the SRC. ( ii ) The fuel used for mileage accumulation must comply with the mileage accumulation fuel provisions of \u00a7 86.113 for the applicable fuel type (e.g., gasoline or diesel fuel). ( iii ) The DDV must be ballasted to a minimum of the loaded vehicle weight for light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks and a minimum of the ALVW for all other vehicles. ( iv ) The mileage accumulation dynamometer must be setup as follows: ( A ) The simulated test weight will be the equivalent test weight specified in \u00a7 86.129 using a weight basis of the loaded vehicle weight for light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks, and ALVW for all other vehicles. ( B ) The road force simulation will be determined according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.129 . ( C ) The manufacturer will control the vehicle, engine, and/or dynamometer as appropriate to follow the SRC using good engineering judgement. ( 2 ) Mileage accumulation must be conducted for at least 75% of the applicable full useful life mileage period specified in \u00a7 86.1805 . If the mileage accumulation is less than 100% of the full useful life mileage, then the DF calculated according to the procedures of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section must be based upon a line projected to the full-useful life mileage using the upper 80 percent statistical confidence limit calculated from the emission data. ( 3 ) If a manufacturer elects to calculate a DF pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, then it must conduct at least one FTP emission test at each of five different mileage points selected using good engineering judgement. Additional testing may be conducted by the manufacturer using good engineering judgement. The required testing must include testing at 5,000 miles and at the highest mileage point run during mileage accumulation (e.g. the full useful life mileage). Different testing plans may be used providing that the manufacturer determines, using good engineering judgement, that the alternative plan would result in an equivalent or superior level of confidence in the accuracy of the DF calculation compared to the testing plan specified in this paragraph. ( d ) Standard bench-aging durability procedure. This procedure is not applicable to diesel fueled vehicles or vehicles which do not use a catalyst as the principle after-treatment emission control device. This procedure requires installation of the catalyst-plus-oxygen-sensor system on a catalyst aging bench. Aging on the bench is conducted by following the standard bench cycle (SBC) for the period of time calculated from the bench aging time (BAT) equation. The BAT equation requires, as input, catalyst time-at-temperature data measured on the SRC. ( 1 ) Standard bench cycle (SBC). Standard catalyst bench aging is conducted following the SBC ( i ) The SBC must be run for the period of time calculated from the BAT equation. ( ii ) The SBC is described in appendix VII to part 86. ( 2 ) Catalyst time-at-temperature data ( i ) Catalyst temperature must be measured during at least two full cycles of the SRC. ( ii ) Catalyst temperature must be measured at the highest temperature location in the hottest catalyst on the DDV. Alternatively, the temperature may be measured at another location providing that it is adjusted to represent the temperature measured at the hottest location using good engineering judgement. ( iii ) Catalyst temperature must be measured at a minimum rate of one hertz (one measurement per second). ( iv ) The measured catalyst temperature results must be tabulated into a histogram with temperature bins of no larger than 25 \u00b0C. ( 3 ) Bench-aging time. Bench aging time is calculated using the bench aging time (BAT) equation as follows: t e for a temperature bin = t h e ((R/Tr)\u2212(R/Tv)) Total t e = Sum of t e over all the temperature bins Bench-Aging Time = A (Total t e ) Where: A = 1.1 This value adjusts the catalyst aging time to account for deterioration from sources other than thermal aging of the catalyst. R = Catalyst thermal reactivity coefficient. You may use a default value of 17,500 for the SBC. t h = The time (in hours) measured within the prescribed temperature bin of the vehicle's catalyst temperature histogram adjusted to a full useful life basis e.g., if the histogram represented 400 miles, and full useful life was 100,000 miles; all histogram time entries would be multiplied by 250 (100000/400). Total t e = The equivalent time (in hours) to age the catalyst at the temperature of T r on the catalyst aging bench using the catalyst aging cycle to produce the same amount of deterioration experienced by the catalyst due to thermal deactivation over the vehicle's full useful life. t e for a bin = The equivalent time (in hours) to age the catalyst at the temperature of T r on the catalyst aging bench using the catalyst aging cycle to produce the same amount of deterioration experienced by the catalyst due to thermal deactivation at the temperature bin of T v over the vehicle's full useful life. T r = The effective reference temperature (in \u00b0K) of the catalyst on the catalyst bench run on the bench aging cycle. The effective temperature is the constant temperature that would result in the same amount of aging as the various temperatures experienced during the bench aging cycle. T v = The mid-point temperature (in \u00b0K) of the temperature bin of the vehicle on-road catalyst temperature histogram. ( 4 ) Effective reference temperature on the SBC. The effective reference temperature of the standard bench cycle (SBC) is determined for the actual catalyst system design and actual aging bench which will be used using the following procedures: ( i ) Measure time-at-temperature data in the catalyst system on the catalyst aging bench following the SBC. ( A ) Catalyst temperature must be measured at the highest temperature location of the hottest catalyst in the system. Alternatively, the temperature may be measured at another location providing that it is adjusted to represent the temperature measured at the hottest location using good engineering judgement. ( B ) Catalyst temperature must be measured at a minimum rate of one hertz (one measurement per second) during at least 20 minutes of bench aging. ( C ) The measured catalyst temperature results must be tabulated into a histogram with temperature bins of no larger than 10 \u00b0C. ( ii ) The BAT equation must be used to calculate the effective reference temperature by iterative changes to the reference temperature (T r ) until the calculated aging time equals the actual time represented in the catalyst temperature histogram. The resulting temperature is the effective reference temperature on the SBC for that catalyst system and aging bench. ( 5 ) Catalyst Aging Bench. The manufacturer must design, using good engineering judgement, a catalyst aging bench that follows the SBC and delivers the appropriate exhaust flow, exhaust constituents, and exhaust temperature to the face of the catalyst. ( i ) A manufacturer may use the criteria and equipment discussed in appendix VIII to part 86 to develop its catalyst aging bench without prior Agency approval. The manufacturer may use another design that results in equivalent or superior results with advance Agency approval. ( ii ) All bench aging equipment and procedures must record appropriate information (such as measured A/F ratios and time-at-temperature in the catalyst) to assure that sufficient aging has actually occurred. ( 6 ) Required Testing. If a manufacturer is electing to calculate a DF (as discussed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section), then it must conduct at least two FTP emissions tests on the DDV before bench aging of emission control hardware and at least two FTP emission tests on the DDV after the bench-aged emission hardware is re-installed. Additional testing may be conducted by the manufacturer using good engineering judgement. ( e ) Additional durability procedures \u2014 ( 1 ) Whole vehicle durability procedures. A manufacturer may use either a customized SRC or an alternative road cycle for the required durability demonstration, with prior EPA approval. ( i ) Customized SRC. A customized SRC is the SRC run for a different number of miles and/or using a different mileage accumulation fuel with higher levels of certain compounds that may lead to catalyst poisoning, such as phosphorus, sulfur and lead, than specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. ( ii ) Alternative road cycle. An alternative cycle is a whole vehicle mileage accumulation cycle that uses a different speed-versus-time trace than the SRC, conducted for either the full useful life mileage or for less than full useful life mileage. An alternative road cycle may also include the use of fuel with higher levels of certain compounds that may lead to catalyst poisoning, such as phosphorus, sulfur and lead, than specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. ( iii ) Approval criteria. The manufacturer must obtain approval from EPA prior to using a customized/alternative road cycle. EPA may approve a customized/alternative cycle when the manufacturer demonstrates that the cycle is expected to achieve the durability program objective of paragraph (a) of this section for the breadth of vehicles using the customized/alternative cycle. To obtain approval the manufacturer must submit all the following information and perform all the following analyses: ( A ) The manufacturer must supply in-use FTP emission data on past model year vehicles which are applicable to the vehicle designs it intends to cover with the customized/alternative cycle. ( 1 ) The amount of in-use emission data required to demonstrate the effectiveness of a customized/alternative cycle in meeting the durability objective is based on whether the customized/alternative cycle is more or less severe than the SRC. In most cases, EPA will accept a minimum of 20 candidate in-use vehicles tested as-received on the FTP cycle. If the customized/alternative cycle is significantly more severe than the SRC, EPA may accept less data. Conversely, if the customized/alternative cycle is significantly less severe than the SRC, EPA may require more data, up to a maximum of 30 vehicles. ( 2 ) This data set must consist of randomly procured vehicles from actual customer use. The vehicles selected for procurement must cover the breadth of the vehicles that the manufacturer intends to certify using the customized/alternative cycle. Vehicles should be procured and FTP tested in as-received condition under the guidelines of the high mileage IUVP program (ref: 40 CFR 86.1845-04 ). ( 3 ) Manufacturers may use previously generated in-use data from the CAP 2000 IUVP or the RDP \u201creality check\u201d in-use program as well as other sources of in-use emissions data for approval under this section. ( 4 ) Manufacturers must remove unrepresentative data from the data set using good engineering judgement. The manufacturer must provide EPA with the data removed from the analysis and a justification for the removal of that data. ( 5 ) Manufacturers may supply additional in-use data. ( B ) The manufacturer must submit an analysis which includes a comparison of the relative stringency of the customized/alternative cycle to the SRC and a calculated equivalency factor for the cycle. ( 1 ) The equivalency factor may be determined by an evaluation of the SRC and the customized/alternative cycle using catalyst time-at-temperature data from both cycles with the BAT equation to calculate the required bench aging time of each cycle. Once the bench aging time is calculated for each cycle, the equivalency factor is the ratio described by dividing the bench aging time on the customized/alternative cycle by the bench aging time on the SRC. ( 2 ) If emissions data is available from the SRC, as well as time-at-temperature data, then that emissions information may be included in the evaluation of the relative stringency of the two cycles and the development of the equivalency factor. ( 3 ) A separate equivalency factor may be determined for each test group, or test groups may be combined together (using good engineering judgement) to calculate a single equivalency factor. ( C ) The manufacturer must submit an analysis which evaluates whether the durability objective will be achieved for the vehicle designs which will be certified using the customized/alternative cycle. The analysis must address of the following elements: ( 1 ) How the durability objective has been achieved using the data submitted in paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. ( 2 ) How the durability objective will be achieved for the vehicle designs which will be covered by the customized/alternative cycle. This analysis should consider the emissions deterioration impact of the design differences between the vehicles included in the data set required in (e)(1)(iii)(A) of this section and the vehicle designs that the manufacturer intends to certify using the customized/alternative cycle. ( 2 ) Bench-aging durability procedures. A manufacturer may use a customized or alternative bench aging durability procedure for a required durability demonstration, if approved as described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section. A customized/alternative bench aging procedure must use vehicle performance data (such as catalyst temperature) measured on an approved road cycle as part of the algorithm to calculate bench aging time. The manufacturer must obtain approval from the Agency prior to using a customized bench durability procedure. ( i ) The lower control temperature on the SBC may be modified without prior EPA approval provided that the high control temperature is set 90 \u00b0C above the lower control temperature and an approved BAT equation is used to calculate bench aging time. ( ii ) The R-factor used in EPA's BAT equation may be determined experimentally using EPA's standard procedures (specified in appendix IX of this part ) without prior EPA approval. Other experimental techniques to calculate the R-factor require advance EPA approval. To obtain approval, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the calculated bench aging time results in the same (or larger) amount of emission deterioration as the associated road cycle. ( iii ) The A-factor used in EPA's BAT equation may be modified, using good engineering judgement without prior EPA approval, to ensure that the modified durability process will achieve the durability objective of paragraph (a) of this section. ( iv ) Bench aging may be conducted using fuel with additional compounds that may lead to catalyst poisoning, such as phosphorus, sulfur or lead, without prior EPA approval. A manufacturer using fuel with these additional compounds may either calculate a new R-factor or A-factor to assure that the durability objective of paragraph (a) of this section is properly achieved regardless of the use of worst-case fuel, in which case the approval criteria for those changes would apply. ( v ) An approved customized/alternative road cycle may be used to develop catalyst temperature histograms for use in the BAT equation without additional EPA approval beyond the original approval necessary to use that cycle for mileage accumulation. ( vi ) A different bench cycle than the SBC may be used during bench aging with prior EPA approval. To obtain approval the manufacturer must demonstrate that bench aging for the appropriate time on the new bench cycle provides the same or larger amount of emission deterioration as the associated road cycle. ( vii ) A different method to calculate bench aging time may be used with prior EPA approval. To obtain approval the manufacturer must demonstrate that bench aging for the time calculated by the alternative method results in the same or larger amount of emission deterioration as the associated road cycle. ( f ) Use of deterioration program to determine compliance with the standard. A manufacturer may select from two methods for using the results of the deterioration program to determine compliance with the applicable emission standards. Either a deterioration factor (DF) is calculated and applied to the emission data vehicle (EDV) emission results or aged components are installed on the EDV prior to emission testing. ( 1 ) Deterioration factors. ( i ) Deterioration factors are calculated using all FTP emission test data generated during the durability testing program except as noted: ( A ) Multiple tests at a given mileage point are averaged together unless the same number of tests are conducted at each mileage point. ( B ) Before and after maintenance test results are averaged together. ( C ) Zero-mile test results are excluded from the calculation. ( D ) Total hydrocarbon (THC) test points beyond the 50,000-mile (useful life) test point are excluded from the intermediate useful life deterioration factor calculation. ( E ) A procedure may be employed to identify and remove from the DF calculation those test results determined to be statistical outliers providing that the outlier procedure is consistently applied to all vehicles and data points and is approved in advance by the Administrator. ( ii ) The deterioration factor must be based on a linear regression, or another regression technique approved in advance by the Administrator. The deterioration must be a multiplicative or additive factor. Separate factors will be calculated for each regulated emission constituent and for the full and intermediate useful life periods as applicable. Separate DF's are calculated for each durability group except as provided in \u00a7 86.1839 . ( A ) A multiplicative DF will be calculated by taking the ratio of the full or intermediate useful life mileage level, as appropriate (rounded to four decimal places), divided by the stabilized mileage (reference \u00a7 86.1831-01(c) , e.g., 4000-mile) level (rounded to four decimal places) from the regression analysis. The result must be rounded to three-decimal places of accuracy. The rounding required in this paragraph must be conducted in accordance with \u00a7 86.1837 . Calculated DF values of less than one must be changed to one for the purposes of this paragraph. ( B ) An additive DF will be calculated to be the difference between the full or intermediate useful life mileage level (as appropriate) minus the stabilized mileage (reference \u00a7 86.1831-01(c) , e.g., 4000-mile) level from the regression analysis. The full useful life regressed emission value, the stabilized mileage regressed emission value, and the DF result must be rounded to the same precision and using the same procedures as the raw emission results according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1837-01 . Calculated DF values of less than zero must be changed to zero for the purposes of this paragraph. ( iii ) For Tier 3 vehicles, the DF calculated by these procedures will be used for determining full and intermediate useful life compliance with FTP exhaust emission standards, SFTP exhaust emission standards, and cold CO emission standards. At the manufacturer's option and using procedures approved by the Administrator, a separate DF may be calculated exclusively using cold CO test data to determine compliance with cold CO emission standards. Also, at the manufacturer's option and using procedures approved by the Administrator, a separate DF may be calculated exclusively using US06 and/or air conditioning (SC03) test data to determine compliance with the SFTP emission standards. ( iv ) For Tier 4 vehicles, the DF calculated by these procedures may be used for determining compliance with all the standards identified in \u00a7 86.1811-27 . At the manufacturer's option and using procedures approved by the Administrator, manufacturers may calculate a separate DF for the following standards and driving schedules: ( A ) Testing to determine compliance with cold temperature emission standards. ( B ) US06 testing. ( C ) SC03 testing. ( D ) HFET. ( E ) Mid-temperature intermediate soak testing. ( F ) Early driveaway testing. ( G ) High-power PHEV engine starts. ( 2 ) Installation of aged components on emission data vehicles. For full and intermediate useful life compliance determination, the manufacturer may elect to install aged components on an EDV prior to emission testing rather than applying a deterioration factor. Different sets of components may be aged for full and intermediate useful life periods. Components must be aged using an approved durability procedure that complies with paragraph (b) of this section. The list of components to be aged and subsequently installed on the EDV must selected using good engineering judgment. ( g ) [Reserved] ( h ) Application of the durability procedure to future durability groups. The manufacturer may apply a durability procedure approved under paragraphs (c) , (d) or (e) of this section to a durability group, including durability groups in future model years, if the durability process will achieve the objective of paragraph (a) of this section for that durability group. The manufacturer must use good engineering judgment in determining the applicability of an approved durability procedure to a durability group. ( 1 ) Modifications to a durability procedure. ( i ) Standard durability procedures. The manufacturer may modify a standard durability procedure (allowed in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section) by increasing or decreasing the number of miles run on the SRC to represent full or intermediate useful life emissions deterioration or by changing the A-Factor in the BAT equation for a bench aging, using good engineering judgment, to ensure that the modified procedure will achieve the objective of paragraph (a) of this section for that durability group. ( ii ) Customized/Alternative durability procedures. The manufacturer may modify an alternative/customized durability procedure approved under the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, using good engineering judgment, for the purposes of ensuring that the modified procedure will achieve the objective of paragraph (a) of this section for that durability group. ( 2 ) The manufacturer must notify the Administrator of its determination to use an approved (or modified) durability procedure on particular test groups and durability groups prior to, or concurrently with, its submission of the Application for Certification for the affected test groups (notification at an annual preview meeting scheduled before the manufacturer begins certification activities for the model year is preferred). ( 3 ) Prior to certification, the Administrator may reject the manufacturer's determination in paragraph (h) of this section to apply an approved or modified durability procedure for a durability group or test group if: ( i ) It is not made using good engineering judgment, ( ii ) It fails to properly consider data collected under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 86.1845-04 , 86.1846-01 , and 86.1847-01 or other information, or ( iii ) The Administrator determines that the durability procedure has not been shown to achieve the objective of paragraph (a) of this section for particular test groups which the manufacturer plans to cover with the durability procedure. ( i ) Evaluation of the certification durability procedures based on in-use emissions data. ( 1 ) Manufacturers must use the information gathered from the IUVP, as well as other sources of in-use emissions data, to periodically review whether the durability procedure it employs achieves the objective specified in paragraph (a) of this section. ( 2 ) Required analysis of a manufacturer's approved durability procedures. ( i ) In addition to any periodic reviews under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, a manufacturer must conduct a review of whether the durability procedure it employs achieves the durability objective specified in paragraph (a) of this section when the criteria for additional testing specified in \u00a7 86.1846 (b) are activated. ( ii ) These criteria are evaluated independently for all applicable FTP emission constituents. ( iii ) This analysis must be performed for each test group certified by the manufacturer. ( iv ) These procedures apply to the EPA standard durability procedures discussed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section as well as durability procedures approved under paragraph (e) of this section, including modifications under paragraph (h) of this section. ( v ) The analysis must be submitted to EPA no later than 60 days after the submission of the IUVP data report specified in \u00a7 86.1847(f) . ( 3 ) EPA may require a manufacturer to perform an analysis as described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section if EPA is concerned that the manufacturer's durability procedure may not achieve the durability objective of paragraph (a) of this section. ( j ) If, based on the analysis required in paragraph (i) of this section and/or any other information, EPA determines that the durability procedure does not achieve the durability objective of paragraph (a) of this section, EPA may withdraw approval to use the durability procedure or condition approval on modifications to the durability procedure. Such withdrawal or conditional approval will apply to future applications for certification and to the portion of the manufacturer's product line (or the entire product line) that the Administrator determines to be affected. Prior to such a withdrawal the Administrator will give the manufacturer a preliminary notice at least 60 days prior to the final decision. During this period, the manufacturer may submit technical discussion, statistical analyses, additional data, or other information which is relevant to the decision. The Administrator will consider all information submitted by the deadline before reaching a final decision. ( k ) If EPA withdraws approval, under the provisions of paragraph (j) of this section, for a durability procedure approved under the provisions of paragraphs (c) and/or (d) of this section, the following procedures apply: ( 1 ) The manufacturer must select one of the following options for future applications for certification for the applicable portion of the manufacturers product-line affect by the Agency's decision: ( i ) Increase future DFs calculated using the applicable durability process by the average percent-difference between certification levels and IUVP data; or ( ii ) Increase the miles driven on the SRC or the aging time calculated by the BAT equation by the average percent-difference between certification levels and IUVP data, or ( iii ) The manufacturer may obtain approval for a new customized durability process, as allowed in paragraph (e) of this section, that has been demonstrated to meet the durability objective. ( 2 ) If EPA's decision to withdraw approval under the provisions of paragraph (j) of this section is based on fewer than 20 tests, the Administrator may require a smaller adjustment than specified in paragraph (k)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. ( l ) Any manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's withdrawal of approval in paragraphs (j) or (k) of this section. The request must be in writing and must include a statement specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determinations, and data in support of such objection. If, after review of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that the request raises a substantial factual issue, she/he must provide the manufacturer a hearing in accordance with \u00a7 86.1853-01 with respect to such issue. ( m ) Durability demonstration procedures for vehicles subject to the greenhouse gas exhaust emission standards specified in \u00a7 86.1818 . Determine a deterioration factor for each exhaust constituent as described in this paragraph (m) and in 40 CFR 600.113-12(h) through (m) to calculate the composite CREE DF value. ( 1 ) CO 2. ( i ) Unless otherwise specified under paragraph (m)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, manufacturers may use a multiplicative CO 2 deterioration factor of one or an additive deterioration factor of zero to determine full useful life emissions for the FTP and HFET tests. ( ii ) Based on an analysis of industry-wide data, EPA may periodically establish and/or update the deterioration factor for CO 2 emissions, including air conditioning and other credit-related emissions. Deterioration factors established and/or updated under this paragraph (m)(1)(ii) will provide adequate lead time for manufacturers to plan for the change. ( iii ) For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and any other vehicle model the manufacturer determines will experience increased CO 2 emissions over the vehicle's useful life, consistent with good engineering judgment, manufacturers must either install aged batteries and other relevant components on test vehicles as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, determine a deterioration factor based on testing, or provide an engineering analysis that the vehicle is designed such that CO 2 emissions will not increase over the vehicle's useful life. Manufacturers may test using the whole-vehicle mileage accumulation procedures in \u00a7 86.1823-08 (c) or (d)(1) , or manufacturers may request prior EPA approval for an alternative durability procedure based on good engineering judgment. For the testing option, each FTP test performed on the durability data vehicle selected under \u00a7 86.1822 must also be accompanied by an HFET test, and combined FTP/HFET CO 2 results determined by averaging the city (FTP) and highway (HFET) CO2 values, weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively. The deterioration factor will be determined for this combined CO 2 value. Calculated multiplicative deterioration factors that are less than one shall be set to equal one, and calculated additive deterioration factors that are less than zero shall be set to zero. ( 2 ) N 2 O and CH 4 . ( i ) For manufacturers complying with the FTP emission standards for N 2 O and CH 4 specified in \u00a7 86.1818-12(f)(1) or determined under \u00a7 86.1818-12(f)(3) , FTP-based deterioration factors for N 2 O and CH 4 shall be determined according to the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (l) of this section. ( ii ) For manufacturers complying with the fleet averaging option for N 2 O and CH 4 as allowed under \u00a7 86.1818-12(f)(2) , deterioration factors based on FTP testing shall be determined and may be used to determine full useful life emissions for the FTP and HFET tests. The manufacturer may at its option determine separate deterioration factors for the FTP and HFET test cycles, in which case each FTP test performed on the durability data vehicle selected under \u00a7 86.1822 of this part must also be accompanied by an HFET test. ( iii ) For the 2012 through 2016 model years only, manufacturers may use alternative deterioration factors. For N 2 O, the alternative deterioration factor to be used to adjust FTP and HFET emissions is the deterioration factor determined for (or derived from, using good engineering judgment) NO X emissions according to the provisions of this section. For CH 4 , the alternative deterioration factor to be used to adjust FTP and HFET emissions is the deterioration factor determined for (or derived from, using good engineering judgment) NMOG or NMHC emissions according to the provisions of this section. ( 3 ) Other carbon-related exhaust emissions. FTP-based deterioration factors shall be determined for carbon-related exhaust emissions (CREE), hydrocarbons, and CO according to the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (l) of this section. The FTP-based deterioration factor shall be used to determine full useful life emissions for both the FTP (city) and HFET (highway) test cycles. The manufacturer may at its option determine separate deterioration factors for the FTP and HFET test cycles, in which case each FTP test performed on the durability data vehicle selected under \u00a7 86.1822 must also be accompanied by an HFET test. In lieu of determining emission-specific deterioration factors for the specific hydrocarbons of CH 3 OH (methanol), HCHO (formaldehyde), C 2 H 5 OH (ethanol), and C 2 H 4 O (acetaldehyde) as may be required for some alternative fuel vehicles, manufacturers may use the additive or multiplicative deterioration factor determined for (or derived from, using good engineering judgment) NMOG or NMHC emissions according to the provisions of this section. ( 4 ) Air Conditioning leakage and efficiency or other emission credit requirements to comply with exhaust CO 2 standards. Manufactures will attest to the durability of components and systems used to meet the CO 2 standards. Manufacturers may submit engineering data to provide durability demonstration. Deterioration factors do not apply to emission-related components and systems used to generate air conditioning leakage and/or efficiency credits. ( n ) Emission component durability. The manufacturer shall use good engineering judgment to determine that all emission-related components are designed to operate properly for the full useful life of the vehicles in actual use. [ 71 FR 2830 , Jan. 17, 2006, as amended at 74 FR 61548 , Nov. 25, 2009; 75 FR 25688 , May 7, 2010; 76 FR 39521 , July 6, 2011; 76 FR 57378 , Sept. 15, 2011; 77 FR 63161 , Oct. 15, 2012; 79 FR 23726 , Apr. 28, 2014; 81 FR 73991 , Oct. 25, 2016; 88 FR 4479 , Jan. 24, 2023; 89 FR 28176 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1824-08 Durability demonstration procedures for evaporative emissions. This section describes durability demonstration procedures for evaporative emissions. Eligible small-volume manufacturers or small-volume test groups may optionally meet the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 86.1826 and 86.1838 instead of the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (j) of this section. A separate durability demonstration is required for each evaporative/refueling family. ( a ) Durability program objective. The durability program must predict an expected in-use emission deterioration rate and emission level that effectively represents a significant majority of the distribution of emission levels and deterioration in actual use over the full useful life of candidate in-use vehicles of each vehicle design which uses the durability program. This requirement applies for all SHED-based measurements except the bleed emission test. The standard for bleed emissions applies for the full useful life, but manufacturers do not need to establish deterioration factors for bleed emissions. The requirements of this section do not apply for spitback or leak standards. ( b ) Required durability demonstration. Manufacturers must conduct a durability demonstration which satisfies the provisions of either paragraph (c) , (d) , or (e) of this section. ( c ) Whole vehicle evaporative durability demonstration. ( 1 ) Mileage accumulation must be conducted using the SRC or any road cycle approved under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1823-08(e)(1) . ( 2 ) Mileage accumulation must be conducted for either: ( i ) The applicable full useful life mileage period specified in \u00a7 86.1805 , or ( ii ) At least 75 percent of the full useful life mileage. In which case, the manufacturer must calculate a df calculated according to the procedures of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, except that the DF must be based upon a line projected to the full-useful life mileage using the upper 80 percent statistical confidence limit calculated from the emission data. ( 3 ) The manufacturer must conduct at least one evaporative emission test at each of the five different mileage points selected using good engineering judgement. The required testing must include testing at 5,000 miles and at the highest mileage point run during mileage accumulation (e.g. the full useful life mileage). Additional testing may be conducted by the manufacturer using good engineering judgement. The manufacturer may select to run either the 2-day and/or 3-day evaporative test at each test point using good engineering judgement. ( d ) Bench aging evaporative durability procedures. Manufacturers may use bench procedures designed, using good engineering judgement, to evaluate the emission deterioration of evaporative control systems. Manufacturers may base the bench procedure on an evaluation the following potential causes of evaporative emission deterioration: ( 1 ) Cycling of canister loading due to diurnal and refueling events, ( 2 ) Use of various commercially available fuels, including the Tier 2 requirement to include alcohol fuel; ( 3 ) Vibration of components; ( 4 ) Deterioration of hoses, etc. due to environmental conditions; and ( 5 ) Deterioration of fuel cap due to wear. ( e ) Combined whole-vehicle and bench-aging programs. Manufacturers may combine the results of whole vehicle aging and bench aging procedures using good engineering judgement. ( f ) Fuel requirements. ( 1 ) For gasoline fueled vehicles certified to meet the evaporative emission standards set forth in this subpart, any mileage accumulation method for evaporative emissions must employ gasoline fuel for the entire mileage accumulation period which contains ethanol in, at least, the highest concentration permissible in gasoline under federal law and that is commercially available in any state in the United States. Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the manufacturer must determine the appropriate ethanol concentration by selecting the highest legal concentration commercially available during the calendar year before the one in which the manufacturer begins its mileage accumulation. The manufacturer must also provide information acceptable to the Administrator to indicate that the mileage accumulation method is of sufficient design, duration and severity to stabilize the permeability of all non-metallic fuel and evaporative system components to the mileage accumulation fuel constituents. ( 2 ) For flexible-fueled, dual-fueled, multi-fueled, ethanol-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles certified to meet the evaporative emission standards set forth in \u00a7 86.1811-04(e)(1) , any mileage accumulation method must employ fuel for the entire mileage accumulation period which the vehicle is designed to use and which the Administrator determines will have the greatest impact upon the permeability of evaporative and fuel system components. The manufacturer must also provide information acceptable to the Administrator to indicate that the mileage accumulation method is of sufficient design, duration and severity to stabilize the permeability of all non-metallic fuel and evaporative system components to mileage accumulation fuel constituents. ( 3 ) A manufacturer may use other methods, based upon good engineering judgment, to meet the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, as applicable. These methods must be approved in advance by the Administrator and meet the objectives of paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, as applicable: to provide assurance that the permeability of all non-metallic fuel and evaporative system components will not lead to evaporative emission standard exceedance under sustained exposure to commercially available alcohol-containing fuels for the useful life of the vehicle. ( g ) Calculation of a deterioration factor. The manufacturer must calculate a deterioration factor which is applied to the evaporative emission results of the emission data vehicles. The deterioration factor must be based on a linear regression, or an other regression technique approved in advance by the Administrator. The DF will be calculated to be the difference between the full life mileage evaporative level minus the stabilized mileage (e.g., 4000\u2212mile) evaporative level from the regression analysis. The full useful life regressed emission value, the stabilized mileage regressed emission value, and the DF result must be rounded to the same precision and using the same procedures as the raw emission results according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1837-01 . Calculated DF values of less than zero must be changed to zero for the purposes of this paragraph. ( h ) [Reserved] ( i ) If EPA determines based on IUVP data or other information that the durability procedure does not achieve the durability objective of paragraph (a) of this section, EPA may withdraw approval to use the durability procedure or condition approval on modifications to the durability procedure. Such withdrawal or conditional approval will apply to future applications for certification and to the portion of the manufacturer's product line (or the entire product line) that the Administrator determines to be affected. Prior to such a withdrawal the Administrator will give the manufacturer a preliminary notice at least 60 days prior to the final decision. During this period, the manufacturer may submit technical discussion, statistical analyses, additional data, or other information which is relevant to the decision. The Administrator will consider all information submitted by the deadline before reaching a final decision. ( j ) Any manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's withdrawal of approval in paragraph (i) of this section. The request must be in writing and must include a statement specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determinations, and data in support of such objection. If, after review of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that the request raises a substantial factual issue, she/he must provide the manufacturer a hearing in accordance with \u00a7 86.1853-01 with respect to such issue. ( k ) Emission component durability. The manufacturer shall use good engineering judgment to determine that all emission-related components are designed to operate properly for the full useful life of the vehicles in actual use. [ 71 FR 2834 , Jan. 17, 2006, as amended at 79 FR 23726 , Apr. 28, 2014; 89 FR 28176 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1825-08 Durability demonstration procedures for refueling emissions. The durability-related requirements of this section apply for vehicles subject to refueling standards under this subpart. Refer to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 86.1801 and 86.1813 to determine applicability of the refueling standards to different classes of vehicles. Diesel-fueled vehicles may be exempt from the requirements of this section under \u00a7 86.1829 . ( a ) Durability program objective. The durability program must predict an expected in-use emission deterioration rate and emission level that effectively represents a significant majority of the distribution of emission levels and deterioration in actual use over the full useful life of candidate in-use vehicles of each vehicle design which uses the durability program. ( b ) Required durability demonstration. Manufacturers must conduct a durability demonstration which satisfies the provisions of either paragraph (c) , (d) , or (e) of this section. ( c ) Whole vehicle refueling durability demonstration. The following procedures must be used when conducting a whole vehicle durability demonstration: ( 1 ) Mileage accumulation must be conducted using the SRC or a road cycle approved under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1823-08(e)(1) . ( 2 ) Mileage accumulation must be conducted for either: ( i ) The applicable full useful life mileage period specified in \u00a7 86.1805 , or ( ii ) At least 75 percent of the full useful life mileage. In which case, the manufacturer must calculate a df calculated according to the procedures of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, except that the DF must be based upon a line projected to the full-useful life mileage using the upper 80 percent statistical confidence limit calculated from the emission data. ( 3 ) The manufacturer must conduct at least one refueling emission test at each of the five different mileage points selected using good engineering judgement. The required testing must include testing at 5,000 miles and at the highest mileage point run during mileage accumulation (e.g. the full useful life mileage). Additional testing may be conducted by the manufacturer using good engineering judgement. ( d ) Bench aging refueling durability procedures. Manufacturers may use bench procedures designed, using good engineering judgement, to evaluate the emission deterioration of evaporative/refueling control systems. Manufacturers may base the bench procedure on an evaluation the following potential causes of evaporative/refueling emission deterioration: ( 1 ) Cycling of canister loading due to diurnal and refueling events; ( 2 ) Use of various commercially available fuels, including the Tier 2 requirement to include alcohol fuel; ( 3 ) Vibration of components; ( 4 ) Deterioration of hoses, etc. due to environmental conditions; and ( 5 ) Deterioration of fuel cap due to wear. ( e ) Combined whole-vehicle and bench-aging programs. Manufacturers may combine the results of whole vehicle aging and bench aging procedures using good engineering judgement. ( f ) [Reserved] ( g ) Calculation of a deterioration factor. The manufacturer must calculate a deterioration factor which is applied to the evaporative emission results of the emission data vehicles. The deterioration factor must be based on a linear regression, or an other regression technique approved in advance by the Administrator. The DF will be calculated to be the difference between the full life mileage evaporative level minus the stabilized mileage (e.g., 4000-mile) evaporative level from the regression analysis. The full useful life regressed emission value, the stabilized mileage regressed emission value, and the DF result must be rounded to the same precision and using the same procedures as the raw emission results according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1837-01 . Calculated DF values of less than zero must be changed to zero for the purposes of this paragraph. ( h ) Emission component durability. The manufacturer shall use good engineering judgment to determine that all emission-related components are designed to operate properly for the full useful life of the vehicles in actual use. ( i ) If EPA determines based on IUVP data or other information that the durability procedure does not achieve the durability objective of paragraph (a) of this section, EPA may withdraw approval to use the durability procedure or condition approval on modifications to the durability procedure. Such withdrawal or conditional approval will apply to future applications for certification and to the portion of the manufacturer's product line (or the entire product line) that the Administrator determines to be affected. Prior to such a withdrawal the Administrator will give the manufacturer a preliminary notice at least 60 days prior to the final decision. During this period, the manufacturer may submit technical discussion, statistical analyses, additional data, or other information which is relevant to the decision. The Administrator will consider all information submitted by the deadline before reaching a final decision. ( j ) Any manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's withdrawal of approval in paragraph (i) of this section. The request must be in writing and must include a statement specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determinations, and data in support of such objection. If, after review of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that the request raises a substantial factual issue, she/he must provide the manufacturer a hearing in accordance with \u00a7 86.1853-01 with respect to such issue. [ 71 FR 2835 , Jan. 17, 2006, as amended at 89 FR 28177 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1826-01 Assigned deterioration factors for small-volume manufacturers and small-volume test groups. ( a ) Applicability. This program is an option available for small-volume manufacturers and small-volume test groups as described in \u00a7 86.1838 . ( b ) Determination of deterioration factors. No service accumulation method or vehicle/component selection method is required. Deterioration factors for all types of regulated emissions are assigned using the provisions in this paragraph (b) . A separate assigned deterioration factor is required for each durability group. Manufacturers shall use good engineering judgment in applying deterioration factors. Manufacturers may use assigned deterioration factors that the Administrator determines and prescribes. ( 1 ) The deterioration factors will be the Administrator's estimate, periodically updated and published in a guidance document, of the 70th percentile deterioration factors calculated using the industry-wide database of previously completed durability data vehicles or engines used for certification. ( 2 ) The Administrator may use discretion to develop assigned deterioration factors using alternative methods if there is insufficient information to calculate an appropriate industry-wide deterioration factor (for example: a new engine technology coupled with a proven emission control system). These methods may include the use of assigned deterioration factors based on similar durability vehicles. ( 3 ) Alternatively, with advance approval from the Administrator, a manufacturer may use deterioration factors developed by another manufacturer. The manufacturer seeking to use these deterioration factors must\u2014 ( i ) Demonstrate that the engines from the two manufacturers share technical parameters to the degree that would support the conclusion that a common deterioration factor should apply for both vehicle configurations as defined in \u00a7 86.1803 . ( ii ) Provide supporting information, such as histograms of exhaust temperature data, comparisons of vehicle weight and road load horsepower, or comparisons of powertrains and emission control systems. [ 79 FR 23726 , Apr. 28, 2014] \u00a7 86.1827-01 Test group determination. This section applies to the grouping of vehicles into test groups within a durability group. The vehicles covered by an application within a durability group shall be divided into test groups based on the following criteria. The manufacturer shall use good engineering judgment in grouping vehicles into test groups. ( a ) To be included in the same test group, vehicles must be identical in all following respects: ( 1 ) Durability group; ( 2 ) Engine displacement (within a total band width of 15 percent of the largest displacement or 50 CID, whichever is larger); ( 3 ) Number of cylinders or combustion chambers; ( 4 ) Arrangement of cylinders or combustion chambers (e.g. in-line, v-shaped); ( 5 ) Subject to the same emission standards (except for CO 2 ), or FEL in the case of cold temperature NMHC or NMOG+NO X standards, except that a manufacturer may request to group vehicles into the same test group as vehicles subject to more stringent standards, so long as all the vehicles within the test group are certified to the most stringent standards applicable to any vehicle within that test group. For example, manufacturers may include medium-duty vehicles at or below 22,000 pounds GCWR in the same test group with medium-duty vehicles above 22,000 pounds GCWR, but all vehicles included in the test group are then subject to the off-cycle emission standards and testing requirements described in \u00a7 86.1811-27(e) . Light-duty trucks and light-duty vehicles may be included in the same test group if all vehicles in the test group are subject to the same criteria exhaust emission standards. ( b ) Where vehicles are of a type which cannot be divided into test groups based on the criteria listed above (such as non-cylinder engines), the Administrator will establish test groups for those vehicles based upon the features most related to their exhaust emission characteristics. ( c ) Manufacturers may further divide groups determined under paragraph (a) of this section providing the Administrator is notified in advance of any such changes in writing. ( d ) Manufacturers may request the Administrator's approval to combine vehicles into a single test group which would normally not be eligible to be in a single test group. The petition should provide: ( 1 ) Substantial evidence that all the vehicles in the larger grouping will have the similar levels of emissions; ( 2 ) Evidence of equivalent component durability over the vehicle's useful life; ( 3 ) Evidence that the groups will result in sufficient in-use verification program data, appropriate tracking in use, and clear liability for the Agency's recall program; and ( 4 ) A statement that all vehicles within a test group are certified to the most stringent standards applicable to any vehicle within that test group. ( e ) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, a manufacturer of hybrid electric vehicles must create separate test groups based on both the type of battery technology employed by the HEV and upon features most related to their exhaust emission characteristics. ( f ) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, a manufacturer of electric vehicles must create separate test groups based on the type of battery technology, the capacity and voltage of the battery, and the type and size of the electric motor. [ 64 FR 23925 , May 4, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 6864 , Feb. 10, 2000; 65 FR 59974 , Oct. 6, 2000; 72 FR 8566 , Feb. 26, 2007; 75 FR 25689 , May 7, 2010; 89 FR 28177 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1828-01 Emission data vehicle selection. ( a ) Criteria exhaust testing. Within each test group, the vehicle configuration shall be selected which is expected to be worst-case for exhaust emission compliance on candidate in-use vehicles, considering all criteria exhaust emission constituents, all exhaust test procedures, and the potential impact of air conditioning on test results. For vehicles meeting Tier 4 standards, include consideration of cold temperature testing. See paragraph (c) of this section for cold temperature testing with vehicles not yet subject to Tier 4 standards. The selected vehicle will include an air conditioning engine code unless the worst-case vehicle configuration selected is not available with air conditioning. This vehicle configuration will be used as the EDV calibration. ( b ) Evaporative/Refueling testing. Vehicles of each evaporative/refueling family will be divided into evaporative/refueling emission control systems. ( 1 ) The vehicle configuration expected to exhibit the highest evaporative and/or refueling emission on candidate in-use vehicles shall be selected for each evaporative/refueling family and evaporative refueling emission system combination from among the corresponding vehicles selected for testing under paragraph (a) of this section. Separate vehicles may be selected to be tested for evaporative and refueling testing. ( 2 ) Each test group must be represented by both evaporative and refueling testing (provided that the refueling standards are applicable) before it may be certified. That required testing may have been conducted on a vehicle in another test group provided the tested vehicle is a member of the same evaporative/refueling family and evaporative/refueling emission system combination and it was selected for testing in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. ( 3 ) For evaporative/refueling emission testing, the vehicle(s) selected shall be equipped with the worst-case evaporative/refueling emission hardware available on that vehicle considering such items as canister size and material, fuel tank size and material, purge strategy and flow rates, refueling characteristics, and amount of vapor generation. ( c ) Cold temperature testing\u2014Tier 3. For vehicles subject to Tier 3 standards, select test vehicles for cold temperature testing as follows: ( 1 ) For cold temperature CO exhaust emission compliance for each durability group, the vehicle expected to emit the highest CO emissions at 20 degrees F on candidate in-use vehicles shall be selected from the test vehicles selected in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. ( 2 ) For cold temperature NMHC exhaust emission compliance for each durability group, the manufacturer must select the vehicle expected to emit the highest NMHC emissions at 20 \u00b0F on candidate in-use vehicles from the test vehicles specified in paragraph (a) of this section. When the expected worst-case cold temperature NMHC vehicle is also the expected worst-case cold temperature CO vehicle as selected in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then cold temperature testing is required only for that vehicle; otherwise, testing is required for both the worst-case cold temperature CO vehicle and the worst-case cold temperature NMHC vehicle. ( d ) [Reserved] ( e ) Alternative configurations. The manufacturer may use good engineering judgment to select an equivalent or worst-case configuration in lieu of testing the vehicle selected in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. Carryover data satisfying the provisions of \u00a7 86.1839 may also be used in lieu of testing the configuration selected in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. ( f ) Good engineering judgment. The manufacturer shall use good engineering judgment in making selections of vehicles under this section. [ 89 FR 28177 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1829-15 Durability and emission testing requirements; waivers. This section describes general testing requirements for certifying vehicles under this subpart, and includes several provisions allowing for statements of compliance instead of testing in certain circumstances. Where a manufacturer provides a statement instead of test data under this section, it must be based on previous emission tests, development tests, or other appropriate information, and on good engineering judgment. ( a ) Durability requirements apply as follows: ( 1 ) One durability demonstration is required for each durability group. The configuration of the DDV is determined according to \u00a7 86.1822 . The DDV shall be tested and accumulate service mileage according to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 86.1823 , 86.1824 , 86.1825 , and 86.1831 . Small-volume manufacturers and small-volume test groups may optionally use the alternative durability provisions of \u00a7 86.1838 . ( 2 ) Manufacturers may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with the monitor accuracy and battery durability requirements of \u00a7 86.1815-27 instead of submitting test data for certification. The following durability testing requirements apply for battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles after certification: ( i ) Manufacturers must perform monitor accuracy testing on in-use vehicles as described in \u00a7 86.1845-04(g) for each monitor family. Carryover provisions apply as described in \u00a7 86.1839-01(c) . ( ii ) Manufacturers must perform battery durability testing as described in \u00a7 86.1815-27 . ( b ) The manufacturer must test EDVs as follows to demonstrate compliance with emission standards: ( 1 ) Except as specified in this section, test one EDV in each test group using the test procedures specified in this subpart to demonstrate compliance with other exhaust emission standards. ( 2 ) Test one EDV in each test group using the test procedures in 40 CFR part 1066 to demonstrate compliance with cold temperature exhaust emission standards. ( 3 ) Test one EDV in each test group to each of the three discrete mid-temperature intermediate soak standards identified in \u00a7 86.1811-27 . ( 4 ) Test one EDV in each evaporative/refueling family and evaporative/refueling emission control system combination using the test procedures in subpart B of this part to demonstrate compliance with evaporative and refueling emission standards. ( c ) The manufacturer must demonstrate compliance with emission standards at low-altitude conditions as described in paragraph (b) of this section. For standards that apply at high-altitude conditions, the manufacturer may either perform the same tests or provide a statement in the application for certification that, based on an engineering evaluation of appropriate testing to measure or simulate high-altitude emissions, all vehicles comply with applicable emission standards at high altitude. ( d ) Manufacturers may omit exhaust testing for certification in certain circumstances as follows: ( 1 ) For vehicles subject to the Tier 3 PM standards in \u00a7 86.1811-17 (not the Tier 4 PM standards in \u00a7 86.1811-27 ), a manufacturer may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with applicable PM standards instead of submitting PM test data for a certain number of vehicles. However, each manufacturer must test vehicles from a minimum number of durability groups as follows: ( i ) Manufacturers with a single durability group subject to the Tier 3 PM standards in \u00a7 86.1811 must submit PM test data for that group. ( ii ) Manufacturers with two to eight durability groups subject to the Tier 3 PM standards in \u00a7 86.1811 must submit PM test data for at least two durability groups each model year. EPA will work with the manufacturer to select durability groups for testing, with the general expectation that testing will rotate to cover a manufacturer's whole product line over time. If a durability group has been certified in an earlier model year based on submitted PM data, and that durability group is eligible for certification using carryover test data, that carryover data may count toward meeting the requirements of this paragraph (d)(1) , subject to the selection of durability groups. ( iii ) Manufacturers with nine or more durability groups subject to the Tier 3 PM standards in \u00a7 86.1811 must submit PM test data for at least 25 percent of those durability groups each model year. We will work with the manufacturer to select durability groups for testing as described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. ( 2 ) Small-volume manufacturers may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with the applicable Tier 3 PM standard instead of submitting test data. Small-volume manufacturers must submit PM test data for vehicles that are subject to Tier 4 PM standards. ( 3 ) Manufacturers may omit PM measurements for fuel economy and GHG testing conducted in addition to the testing needed to demonstrate compliance with the PM emission standards. ( 4 ) Manufacturers may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with the applicable formaldehyde standard instead of submitting test data. ( 5 ) When conducting Selective Enforcement Audit testing, a manufacturer may petition the Administrator to waive the requirement to measure PM emissions and formaldehyde emissions. ( 6 ) For model years 2012 through 2016, a manufacturer may provide a statement in its application for certification that vehicles comply with the applicable standards instead of measuring N 2 O emissions. Such a statement may also be used for model year 2017 and 2018 vehicles only if the application for certification for those vehicles is based upon data carried over from a prior model year, as allowed under this subpart. No model year 2019 and later vehicles may be waived from testing for N 2 O emissions. Vehicles certified to N 2 O standards using a compliance statement instead of submitting test data are not required to collect and submit N 2 O emission data under the in-use testing requirements of \u00a7 86.1845 . ( 7 ) Manufacturers may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with the mid-temperature intermediate soak standards for soak times not covered by testing. ( 8 ) Manufacturers may provide a statement in the application for certification that medium-duty vehicles above 22,000 pounds GCWR comply with the off-cycle emission standards in \u00a7 86.1811-27(e) for all normal operation and use when tested as specified. Describe in the application for certification under \u00a7 86.1844-01(d)(8) any relevant testing, engineering analysis, or other information in sufficient detail to support the statement. We may direct you to include emission measurements representing typical engine in-use operation at a range of ambient conditions. For example, we may specify certain transient and steady-state engine operation that is typical for your vehicles. Also describe the procedure you used to determine a reference CO 2 emission rate, e CO2FTPFCL , under \u00a7 86.1845-04(h)(6) . ( 9 ) For model year 2027 and 2028 vehicles subject to the Tier 4 PM standards in \u00a7 86.1811-27 , a manufacturer may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with the PM standard for \u22127 \u00b0C temperature testing instead of submitting PM test data. ( e ) Manufacturers may omit evaporative or refueling testing for certification in certain circumstances as follows: ( 1 ) For diesel-fueled vehicles, a manufacturer may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with the refueling emission standard instead of submitting test data. ( 2 ) For vehicles fueled by natural gas, a manufacturer may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with evaporative emission standards instead of submitting test data. Compressed natural gas vehicles meeting the requirements for fueling connection devices in \u00a7 86.1813-17(f)(1) are deemed to comply with evaporative and refueling emission standards. ( 3 ) For vehicles fueled by liquefied petroleum gas, a manufacturer may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with evaporative and refueling emission standards instead of submitting test data, except that refueling tests are required for systems that allow venting during the refueling operation. ( 4 ) Manufacturers may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with the leak standard in \u00a7 86.1813 instead of submitting test data. ( 5 ) For vehicles certified to the refueling emission standards in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811 or 86.1813 , a manufacturer may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with the fuel dispensing spitback standard instead of submitting test data. ( 6 ) In lieu of testing vehicles for the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, a manufacturer may optionally provide a statement of compliance in its application for certification that, based on the manufacturer's good engineering judgment, all vehicles in the evaporative/refueling emission family comply with the evaporative emission standard for the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence. ( i ) The option to provide a statement of compliance in lieu of 2-diurnal evaporative certification test data is limited to vehicles with conventional evaporative emission control systems (as determined by the Administrator). EPA may perform confirmatory 2-diurnal evaporative emission testing on test vehicles certified using this option. If data shows noncompliance, it will be addressed through \u00a7 86.1851 . Also, if data shows noncompliance, EPA will generally disallow subsequent waivers for the applicable evaporative family. ( ii ) Manufacturers shall supply information if requested by EPA in support of the statement of compliance described in this paragraph (e)(6) . This information shall include evaporative calibration information for the emission-data vehicle and for other vehicles in the evaporative/refueling family, including, but not limited to, canister type, canister volume, canister working capacity, canister shape and internal configuration, fuel tank volume, fuel tank geometry, the type of fuel delivery system (return, returnless, variable flow fuel pump, etc.), a description of the input parameters and software strategy used to control the evaporative canister purge, the nominal purge flow volume (in bed volumes) when vehicles are driven over the 2-diurnal (FTP) driving cycle, the nominal purge flow volume (in bed volumes) when vehicles are driven over the 3-diurnal (FTP + running loss) driving cycle, and other supporting information as necessary to demonstrate that the purge flow rate calibration on the 2-diurnal test sequence is adequate to comply with the evaporative emission standard for the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence. ( 7 ) Where a California evaporative emission standard is at least as stringent as a comparable federal evaporative emission standard for a vehicle, we may accept test data demonstrating compliance with the California standard as demonstrating compliance with the comparable standard under this subpart. We may require you to provide test data clearly demonstrating that a vehicle tested using the California-specified test procedures will meet the comparable standard under this subpart when tested using the test procedures specified in this part. ( 8 ) Through model year 2019, we may accept test data demonstrating compliance with the California refueling emission standard as demonstrating compliance with the analogous refueling emission standard under this subpart if all the following conditions apply: ( i ) You certified the vehicles in model year 2016 to California's refueling emission standards. ( ii ) You are certifying the vehicles to refueling standards for the new model year based on carryover data instead of performing new testing. ( iii ) You are also certifying the vehicles for evaporative emissions based on California test procedures under the provisions of paragraph (e)(6) of this section. ( 9 ) For complete vehicles above 10,000 pounds GVWR with fuel tanks exceeding 35 gallons nominal fuel tank capacity, and for any incomplete vehicles above 10,000 pounds GVWR, a manufacturer may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with refueling emission standards instead of submitting test data, consistent with 40 CFR 1037.103(c) . ( f ) For electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles, manufacturers may provide a statement in the application for certification that vehicles comply with all the emission standards and related requirements of this subpart instead of submitting test data. Tailpipe emissions of regulated pollutants from vehicles powered solely by electricity are deemed to be zero. ( g ) Manufacturers must measure NMOG+NO X emissions from \u22127 \u00b0C testing with Tier 4 diesel-fueled emission data vehicles and report values corresponding to submitted CO and PM test results in the application for certification. Note that it is not necessary to repeat NMOG+NO X measurements for fuel economy, confirmatory, or in-use testing.

( a ) General test vehicle requirements. ( 1 ) All test vehicles shall be tested in the proper configurations as specified in \u00a7 86.1822-01 , \u00a7 86.1828-01 , or \u00a7 86.1842-01 , as applicable for the type of test conducted. ( 2 ) Components affecting emissions which are used to build test vehicles shall either be randomly selected production parts or parts verified to be in the middle 50 percent of the tolerance range. The manufacturer will determine which components affect emissions using good engineering judgment. ( 3 ) Test vehicles must have air conditioning installed and operational if that configuration is available with air conditioning. Optional equipment must be installed or represented on test vehicles according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1832-01 . ( 4 ) Test vehicles must receive proper scheduled maintenance as established by the manufacturer according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1834-01(b) or (c) . Unscheduled maintenance must be approved under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1834-01(d) . ( 5 ) Vehicle mileage shall be accumulated in accordance with \u00a7 86.1831-01 . ( 6 ) The road load forces and equivalent test weight used during testing will be determined according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.129-00 . ( 7 ) Test vehicles shall have the appropriate emission testing hardware installed (e.g., exhaust pipe testing flange, fuel tank drain, access ports to evaporative canisters, and fuel tank heat blanket) and shall have tires with appropriate tire wear. ( b ) Special provisions for durability data vehicles. ( 1 ) For DDV's, the mileage at all test points shall be within 250 miles of the scheduled mileage point as required under \u00a7 86.1823-08(c)(3) . Manufacturers may exceed the 250 mile upper limit if there are logistical reasons for the deviation and the manufacturer determines that the deviation will not affect the representativeness of the durability demonstration. ( 2 ) For DDV's aged using the standard or a customized/alternative whole-vehicle cycle, all emission-related hardware and software must be installed and operational during all mileage accumulation after the 5000-mile test point. ( 3 ) DDV's may be reconfigured before the 5000-mile test point providing that the representativeness of the emission results will not be affected. Manufacturers shall use good engineering judgment in making such determinations. ( c ) Special provisions for emission data vehicles. ( 1 ) All EDV's shall have at least the minimum number of miles accumulated to achieve stabilized emission results according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1831-01(c) . ( 2 ) Within a durability group, the manufacturer may alter any emission data vehicle (or other vehicles such as current or previous model year emission data vehicles, running change vehicles, fuel economy data vehicles, and development vehicles) in lieu of building a new test vehicle providing that the modification will not impact the representativeness of the vehicle's test results. Manufacturers shall use good engineering judgment in making such determinations. Development vehicles which were used to develop the calibration selected for emission data testing may not be used as the EDV for that configuration. Vehicles from outside the durability group may be altered with advance approval of the Administrator. ( 3 ) Components used to reconfigure EDV's under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be appropriately aged if necessary to achieve representative emission results. Manufacturers must determine the need for component aging and the type and amount of aging required using good engineering judgment. ( 4 ) Bench-aged hardware may be installed on an EDV for emission testing as a method of determining certification levels (projected emission levels at full or intermediate useful life) using bench aging procedures under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1823 .

( 1 ) The manufacturer must accumulate mileage on DDV's using the procedures in \u00a7 86.1823 . ( 2 ) All tests required by this subpart on durability data vehicles shall be conducted within 250 miles of each of the nominal test point mileage. This \u00b1250 mile test point mileage tolerance may be modified with the advance approval of the Administrator if the basis for the written request is to prevent an interruption of durability mileage accumulation due to test scheduling conflicts for weekends, holidays, or other similar circumstances. ( b ) Emission data vehicles and running change vehicles. ( 1 ) The standard method of mileage accumulation for emission data vehicles and running change vehicles is mileage accumulation using either the Standard Road Cycle specified in appendix V to this part or the Durability Driving Schedule specified in appendix IV to this part. ( 2 ) The manufacturer may use an alternative mileage accumulation method providing the form and extent of the service accumulation represents normal driving patterns for that vehicle, the method is consistent with good engineering judgment, and the method is described in the application for certification. ( 3 ) Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, all vehicles will accumulate mileage at a measured curb weight which is within 100 pounds of the estimated curb weight. If the loaded vehicle weight is within 100 pounds of being included in the next higher inertia weight class as specified in \u00a7 86.129 , the manufacturer may elect to conduct the respective emission tests at higher loaded vehicle weight. ( c ) The manufacturer shall determine the mileage at which the emission control system and engine combination is stabilized for emission-data testing. The manufacturer shall provide to the Administrator if requested, a record of the analysis used in making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to accumulate 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) or more on each test vehicle without making a determination. The manufacturer must accumulate a minimum of 1,000 miles (1,608 kilometers) on each emission data vehicle. ( d ) All test vehicle mileage must be accurately determined, recorded, and reported to the Administrator upon request. [ 64 FR 23925 , May 4, 1999, as amended at 71 FR 2836 , Jan. 17, 2006] \u00a7 86.1832-01 Optional equipment and air conditioning for test vehicles. For test vehicles selected under \u00a7\u00a7 86.1822-01 and 86.1828-01 : ( a ) ( 1 ) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a car line, within a test group, will be equipped with an item (whether that item is standard equipment or an option), the full estimated weight of that item must be included in the curb weight computation for each vehicle available with that item in that car line, within that test group. ( 2 ) Where it is expected that 33 percent or less of the car line, within a test group, will be equipped with an item (whether that item is standard equipment or an option), no weight for that item will be added in computing the curb weight for any vehicle in that car line, within that test group, unless that item is standard equipment on the vehicle. ( 3 ) In the case of mutually exclusive options, only the weight of the heavier option will be added in computing the curb weight. ( 4 ) Optional equipment weighing less than three pounds per item need not be considered. ( b ) ( 1 ) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a car line, within a test group, will be equipped with an item (whether that item is standard equipment or an option) that can reasonably be expected to influence emissions, then such items must actually be installed (unless excluded under paragraph (b)(2) of this section) on all emission data and durability data vehicles of that car line, within that test group, on which the items are intended to be offered in production. Items that can reasonably be expected to influence emissions include, but are not limited to: air conditioning, power steering, and power brakes. ( 2 ) If the manufacturer determines by test data or engineering evaluation that the actual installation of the optional equipment required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not affect the emissions or fuel economy values, the optional equipment need not be installed on the test vehicle. ( 3 ) The weight of the options must be included in the design curb weight and must also be represented in the weight of the test vehicles. ( 4 ) The engineering evaluation, including any test data, used to support the deletion of optional equipment from test vehicles, shall be maintained by the manufacturer and be made available to the Agency upon request by the Administrator within 15 business days. ( c ) Except for air conditioning, where it is expected that 33 percent or less of a car line, within a test group, will be equipped with an item (whether that item is standard equipment or an option) that can reasonably be expected to influence emissions, that item may not be installed on any emission data vehicle or durability data vehicle of that car line within that test group, unless that item is standard equipment on that vehicle or specifically required by the Administrator. ( d ) Air conditioning must be installed and operational on any emission data vehicle of any vehicle configuration that is projected to be available with air conditioning regardless of the rate of installation of air conditioning within the car line. Paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section will be used to determine whether the weight of the air conditioner will be included in the equivalent test weight calculations for emission testing. \u00a7 86.1833-01 Adjustable parameters. ( a ) At the time that emission data vehicles are selected for the test fleet, a determination shall be made of those vehicle or engine parameters which will be subject to adjustment for certification, Selective Enforcement Audit and Production Compliance Audit testing, the adequacy of the limits, stops, seals, or other means used to inhibit adjustment, and the resulting physically adjustable ranges for each such parameter. The manufacturer shall use good engineering judgment in making such determinations and shall notify the Administrator of its determinations prior to emission data vehicle testing for the affected test groups (preferably at an annual preview meeting scheduled before the manufacturer begins certification activities for the model year). ( 1 ) Determining parameters subject to adjustment. ( i ) The following parameters may be subject to adjustment: the idle fuel-air mixture parameter on Otto-cycle vehicles; the choke valve action parameter(s) on carbureted, Otto-cycle vehicles (or engines); or any parameter on any vehicle (Otto-cycle or diesel) which is physically capable of being adjusted, may significantly affect emissions, and was not present on the manufacturer's vehicles (or engines) in the previous model year in the same form and function. ( ii ) Any other parameters on any vehicle or engine which are physically capable of being adjusted and which may significantly affect emissions may be determined to be subject to adjustment. However, the Administrator may do so only if he/she has previously notified the manufacturer that he/she might do so and has found, at the time he/she gave this notice, that the intervening period would be adequate to permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period. In no event will this notification be given later than September 1 of the calendar year two years prior to the model year. ( iii ) In determining the parameters subject to adjustment, the following shall be taken into consideration: the likelihood that, for each of the parameters listed in paragraphs (e)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, settings other than the manufacturer's recommended setting will occur on in-use vehicles (or engines). In determining likelihood, such factors may be considered as information contained in the preliminary application, surveillance information from similar in-use vehicles, the difficulty and cost of gaining access to an adjustment, damage to the vehicle if an attempt is made to gain such access and the need to replace parts following such attempt, and the effect of settings other than the manufacturer's recommended setting on vehicle performance characteristics including emission characteristics. ( 2 ) ( i ) A parameter may be determined to be adequately inaccessible or sealed if: ( A ) In the case of an idle mixture screw, the screw is recessed within the carburetor casting and sealed with lead, thermosetting plastic, or an inverted elliptical spacer or sheared off after adjustment at the factory, and the inaccessibility is such that the screw cannot be accessed and/or adjusted with simple tools in one-half hour or for $20 (1978 dollars) or less; ( B ) In the case of a choke bimetal spring, the plate covering the bimetal spring is riveted or welded in place, or held in place with nonreversible screws; ( C ) In the case of a parameter which may be adjusted by elongating or bending adjustable members (e.g., the choke vacuum break), the elongation of the adjustable member is limited by design or, in the case of a bendable member, the member is constructed of a material which when bent would return to its original shape after the force is removed (plastic or spring steel materials); ( D ) In the case of any parameter, the manufacturer demonstrates that adjusting the parameter to settings other than the manufacturer's recommended setting takes more than one-half hour or costs more than $20 (1978 dollars). ( ii ) A physical limit or stop shall be determined to be an adequate restraint on adjustability if: ( A ) In the case of a threaded adjustment, the threads are terminated, pinned, or crimped so as to prevent additional travel without breakage or need for repairs which take more than one-half hour or cost more than $20 (1978 dollars); ( B ) The adjustment is ineffective at the end of the limits of travel regardless of additional forces or torques applied to the adjustment; ( C ) The manufacturer demonstrates that travel or rotation limits cannot be exceeded with the use of simple and inexpensive tools (screwdriver, pliers, open-end or box wrenches, etc.) without incurring significant and costly damage to the vehicle or control system or without taking more than one-half hour or costing more than $20 (1978 dollars). ( iii ) If manufacturer service manuals or bulletins describe routine procedures for gaining access to a parameter or for removing or exceeding a physical limit, stop, seal or other means used to inhibit adjustment, or if surveillance data indicate that gaining access, removing, or exceeding is likely, paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section shall not apply for that parameter. ( iv ) In determining the adequacy of a physical limit, stop, seal, or other means used to inhibit adjustment of a parameter not covered by paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, the following shall be considered: the likelihood that it will be circumvented, removed, or exceeded on in-use vehicles. In determining likelihood, such factors may be considered as, but not limited to, information contained in the preliminary application; surveillance information from similar in-use vehicles; the difficulty and cost of circumventing, removing, or exceeding the limit, stop, seal, or other means; damage to the vehicle if an attempt is made to circumvent, remove, or exceed it and the need to replace parts following such attempt; and the effect of settings beyond the limit, stop, seal, or other means on vehicle performance characteristics other than emission characteristics. ( v ) In the case of electronic components on circuit boards (such as onboard computers) the board is covered with an epoxy resin which inhibits the access to components on the board (commonly referred to as potting). ( 3 ) Two physically adjustable ranges shall be determined for each parameter subject to adjustment: ( i ) ( A ) In the case of a parameter determined to be adequately inaccessible or sealed, the following may be included within the physically adjustable range applicable to testing under this subpart: all settings within the production tolerance associated with the nominal setting for that parameter, as specified by the manufacturer in the application for certification or other information; or ( B ) In the case of other parameters, all settings within physical limits or stops determined to be adequate restraints on adjustability shall be included within this range. The production tolerances on the location of these limits or stops may be included when determining the physically adjustable range. ( ii ) ( A ) In the case of a parameter determined to be adequately inaccessible or sealed, only the actual settings to which the parameter is adjusted during production shall be included within the physically adjustable range applicable to testing under subparts G or K (Selective Enforcement Audit and Production Compliance Audit) of this part; or ( B ) In the case of other parameters, all settings within physical limits or stops determined to be adequate restraints on adjustability, as they are actually located on the test vehicle, shall be included within the range. ( b ) In lieu of making the determinations required in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer may request a determination be made by the Administrator prior to emission testing. In that case, all the information discussed in paragraph (a) of this section shall be provided to the Administrator. The Administrator will respond within 90 days (excluding the elapsed time during which additional information requested by the Administrator is being gathered by the manufacturer) following the receipt of the request for determination. ( c ) If the Administrator determines that the decisions made by the manufacturer under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section were not made using good engineering judgment, the Administrator will overrule the manufacturers' decisions and conduct testing for Certification, Selective Enforcement Audit and/or Production Compliance Audit purposes by adjusting parameters according to his/her determination of those vehicle or engine parameters subject to adjustment, the adequacy of the limits, stops, seals, or other means used to inhibit adjustment, and the resulting physically adjustable ranges for each such parameter. Furthermore, the Administrator may reject testing performed by the manufacturer which failed to follow his/her determinations. ( d ) Within 30 days following receipt of notification of the Administrator's determinations made under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's determinations. The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized representative of the manufacturer, and shall include a statement specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determinations, and data in support of such objections. If, after review of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that the request raises a substantial factual issue, he shall provide the manufacturer a hearing in accordance with \u00a7 86.1853-01 with respect to such issue. \u00a7 86.1834-01 Allowable maintenance. ( a ) Maintenance performed on vehicles, engines, subsystems, or components used to determine exhaust, evaporative or refueling emission deterioration factors, as appropriate, is classified as either emission-related or non-emission-related and each of these can be classified as either scheduled or unscheduled. Further, some emission-related maintenance is also classified as critical emission-related maintenance. ( b ) This section specifies emission-related scheduled maintenance for purposes of obtaining durability data and for inclusion in maintenance instructions furnished to purchasers of new motor vehicles and under \u00a7 86.1808-01 . ( 1 ) All emission-related scheduled maintenance for purposes of obtaining durability data must occur at the same mileage intervals (or equivalent intervals if engines, subsystems, or components are used) that will be specified in the manufacturer's maintenance instructions furnished to the ultimate purchaser of the motor vehicle or engine under \u00a7 86.1808-01 . This maintenance schedule may be updated as necessary throughout the testing of the vehicle/engine, provided that no maintenance operation is deleted from the maintenance schedule after the operation has been performed on the test vehicle or engine. ( 2 ) Any emission-related maintenance which is performed on vehicles, engines, subsystems, or components must be technologically necessary to assure in-use compliance with the emission standards. Manufacturers shall determine the technological need for maintenance using good engineering judgment. The Administrator has determined that emission-related maintenance at shorter intervals than those outlined in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section is not technologically necessary to ensure in-use compliance. However, the Administrator may determine that maintenance even more restrictive (e.g., longer intervals) than that listed in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section is also not technologically necessary. ( 3 ) Emission-related maintenance in addition to, or at shorter intervals than, that listed in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section will not be accepted as technologically necessary, except as provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this section. ( i ) ( A ) The cleaning or replacement of light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck spark plugs shall occur at 30,000 miles of use and at 30,000-mile intervals thereafter. ( B ) The cleaning or replacement of complete heavy-duty vehicle spark plugs shall occur at 25,000 miles (or 750 hours) of use and at 30,000-mile (or 750 hour) intervals thereafter, for vehicles certified for use with unleaded fuel only. ( ii ) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, the adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of the following items shall occur at 50,000 miles of use and at 50,000-mile intervals thereafter: ( A ) Positive crankcase ventilation valve. ( B ) Emission-related hoses and tubes. ( C ) Ignition wires. ( D ) Idle mixture. ( iii ) For complete heavy-duty vehicles, the adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of the following items shall occur at 50,000 miles (or 1,500 hours) of use and at 50,000-mile (1,500 hour) intervals thereafter: ( A ) Positive crankcase ventilation valve. ( B ) Emission-related hoses and tubes. ( C ) Ignition wires. ( D ) Idle mixture. ( E ) Exhaust gas recirculation system related filters and coolers. ( iv ) For light-duty trucks, light-duty vehicles, and complete heavy-duty vehicles, the adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of the oxygen sensor shall occur at 80,000 miles (or 2,400 hours) of use and at 80,000-mile (or 2,400-hour) intervals thereafter. ( v ) For light-duty trucks and light-duty vehicles, the adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of the following items shall occur at 100,000 miles of use and at 100,000-mile intervals thereafter: ( A ) Catalytic converter. ( B ) Air injection system components. ( C ) Fuel injectors. ( D ) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors (except oxygen sensor) and actuators. ( E ) Evaporative and/or refueling emission canister(s). ( F ) Turbochargers. ( G ) Carburetors. ( H ) Superchargers. ( I ) Exhaust gas recirculation system including all related filters and control valves. ( J ) Mechanical fillpipe seals. ( vi ) For complete heavy-duty vehicles, the adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of the following items shall occur at 100,000 miles (or 3,000 hours) of use and at 100,000-mile (or 3,000 hour) intervals thereafter: ( A ) Catalytic converter. ( B ) Air injection system components. ( C ) Fuel injectors. ( D ) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors (except oxygen sensor) and actuators. ( E ) Evaporative and/or refueling emission canister(s). ( F ) Turbochargers. ( G ) Carburetors. ( H ) Exhaust gas recirculation system (including all related control valves and tubing) except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(E) of this section. ( I ) Mechanical fillpipe seals. ( 4 ) For diesel-cycle vehicles, emission-related maintenance in addition to, or at shorter intervals than the following will not be accepted as technologically necessary, except as provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this section: ( i ) The adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of the positive crankcase ventilation valve shall occur at 50,000 miles of use and at 50,000-mile intervals thereafter. ( ii ) The adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement shall occur at 100,000 miles of use and at 100,000-mile intervals thereafter of the following items: ( A ) Fuel injectors. ( B ) Turbocharger. ( C ) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors and actuators. ( D ) Particulate trap or trap-oxidizer system (including related components). ( E ) Exhaust gas recirculation system including all related filters and control valves. ( F ) Catalytic converter. ( G ) Superchargers. ( iii ) For vehicles that use selective catalytic reduction, the replenishment of diesel exhaust fluid shall occur at an interval that is no less than 4,000 miles for typical operation. ( 5 ) [Reserved] ( 6 ) Critical emission-related components. ( i ) The following components are defined as critical emission-related components: ( A ) Catalytic converter. ( B ) Air injection system components. ( C ) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors (including oxygen sensor if installed) and actuators. ( D ) Exhaust gas recirculation system (including all related filters and control valves). ( E ) Positive crankcase ventilation valve. ( F ) Evaporative and refueling emission control system components (excluding canister air filter). ( G ) Particulate trap or trap-oxidizer system. ( H ) Components comprising the selective catalytic reduction system (including diesel exhaust fluid tank). ( I ) Any other component whose primary purpose is to reduce emissions or whose failure would commonly increase emissions of any regulated pollutant without significantly degrading engine performance. ( ii ) All critical emission-related scheduled maintenance must have a reasonable likelihood of being performed in-use. The manufacturer shall be required to show the reasonable likelihood of such maintenance being performed in-use, and such showing shall be made prior to the performance of the maintenance on the durability data vehicle. Critical emission-related scheduled maintenance items which satisfy one of the conditions defined in paragraphs (b)(6)(ii) (A) through (F) of this section will be accepted as having a reasonable likelihood of the maintenance item being performed in-use, except that DEF replenishment must satisfy paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A) or (b)(6)(ii)(F) of this section to be accepted as having a reasonable likelihood of the maintenance item being performed in-use. ( A ) Data are presented which establish for the Administrator a connection between emissions and vehicle performance such that as emissions increase due to lack of maintenance, vehicle performance will simultaneously deteriorate to a point unacceptable for typical driving. ( B ) Survey data are submitted which adequately demonstrate to the Administrator that, at an 80 percent confidence level, 80 percent of such engines already have this critical maintenance item performed in use at the recommended interval(s). ( C ) A clearly displayed visible signal system approved by the Administrator is installed to alert the vehicle driver that maintenance is due. A signal bearing the message \u201cmaintenance needed\u201d or \u201ccheck engine,\u201d or a similar message approved by the Administrator, shall be actuated at the appropriate mileage point or by component failure. This signal must be continuous while the engine is in operation and not be easily eliminated without performance of the required maintenance. Resetting the signal shall be a required step in the maintenance operation. The method for resetting the signal system shall be approved by the Administrator. ( D ) A manufacturer may desire to demonstrate through a survey that a critical maintenance item is likely to be performed without a visible signal on a maintenance item for which there is no prior in-use experience without the signal. To that end, the manufacturer may in a given model year market up to 200 randomly selected vehicles per critical emission-related maintenance item without such visible signals, and monitor the performance of the critical maintenance item by the owners to show compliance with paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(B) of this section. This option is restricted to two consecutive model years and may not be repeated until any previous survey has been completed. If the critical maintenance involves more than one test group, the sample will be sales weighted to ensure that it is representative of all the groups in question. ( E ) The manufacturer provides the maintenance free of charge, and clearly informs the customer that the maintenance is free in the instructions provided under \u00a7 86.1808-01 . ( F ) Any other method which the Administrator approves as establishing a reasonable likelihood that the critical maintenance will be performed in use. ( iii ) Visible signal systems used under paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(C) of this section are considered an element of design of the emission control system. Therefore, disabling, resetting, or otherwise rendering such signals inoperative without also performing the indicated maintenance procedure is a prohibited act under section 203(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7522(a)(3) ). ( 7 ) Changes to scheduled maintenance. ( i ) For maintenance practices that existed prior to the 1980 model year, only the maintenance items listed in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section are currently considered by EPA to be emission-related. The Administrator may, however, determine additional scheduled maintenance items that existed prior to the 1980 model year to be emission-related by announcement in a Federal Register Notice. In no event may this notification occur later than September 1 of the calendar year two years prior to the affected model year. ( ii ) In the case of any new scheduled maintenance, the manufacturer must submit a request for approval to the Administrator for any maintenance that it wishes to recommend to purchasers and perform during durability determination. New scheduled maintenance is that maintenance which did not exist prior to the 1980 model year, including that which is a direct result of the implementation of new technology not found in production prior to the 1980 model year. The manufacturer must also include its recommendations as to the category (i.e., emission-related or non-emission-related, critical or non-critical) of the subject maintenance and, for suggested emission-related maintenance, the maximum feasible maintenance interval. Such requests must include detailed evidence supporting the need for the maintenance requested, and supporting data or other substantiation for the recommended maintenance category and for the interval suggested for emission-related maintenance. Requests for new scheduled maintenance must be approved prior to the introduction of the new maintenance. The Administrator will then designate the maintenance as emission-related or non-emission-related. For maintenance items established as emission-related, the Administrator will further designate the maintenance as critical if the component which receives the maintenance is a critical component under paragraph (b)(6) of this section. For each maintenance item designated as emission-related, the Administrator will also establish a technologically necessary maintenance interval, based on industry data and any other information available to EPA. Designations of emission-related maintenance items, along with their identification as critical or non-critical, and establishment of technologically necessary maintenance intervals, will be announced in the Federal Register. ( iii ) Any manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's determinations in this paragraph (b)(7) . The request shall be in writing and shall include a statement specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determinations, and data in support of such objections. If, after review of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that the request raises a substantial factual issue, he shall provide the manufacturer a hearing in accordance with \u00a7 86.1853-01 with respect to such issue. ( c ) Non-emission-related scheduled maintenance which is reasonable and technologically necessary (e.g., oil change, oil filter change, fuel filter change, air filter change, cooling system maintenance, adjustment of idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque, valve lash, injector lash, timing, adjustment of air pump drive belt tension, lubrication of the exhaust manifold heat control valve, lubrication of carburetor choke linkage, re-torquing carburetor mounting bolts, etc.) may be performed on durability data vehicles at the least frequent intervals recommended by the manufacturer to the ultimate purchaser, (e.g., not at the intervals recommended for severe service). ( d ) Unscheduled maintenance on durability data vehicles. ( 1 ) Unscheduled maintenance may be performed during the testing used to determine deterioration factors, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, only under the following provisions defined in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section: ( i ) A fuel injector or spark plug may be changed if a persistent misfire is detected. ( ii ) Readjustment of an Otto-cycle vehicle cold-start enrichment system may be performed if there is a problem of stalling. ( iii ) Readjustment of the engine idle speed (curb idle and fast idle) may be performed in addition to that performed as scheduled maintenance under paragraph (c) of this section if the idle speed exceeds the manufacturer's recommended idle speed by 300 rpm or more, or if there is a problem of stalling. ( 2 ) Any other unscheduled vehicle, emission control system, or fuel system adjustment, repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or replacement during testing to determine deterioration factors shall be performed (using good engineering judgment) only in the following circumstances: ( i ) The part failure or system malfunction, or the repair of such failure or malfunction, does not render the vehicle or engine unrepresentative of vehicles or engines in use and does not require direct access to the combustion chamber, except for spark plug, fuel injection component, or removable prechamber removal or replacement. ( ii ) The need for maintenance or repairs is indicated by an overt indication of malfunction such as persistent misfiring, engine stalling, overheating, fluid leakage, loss of oil pressure, excessive fuel consumption, or excessive power loss. The Administrator shall be given the opportunity to verify the existence of an overt indication of part failure and/or vehicle/engine malfunction (e.g., misfiring, stalling, black smoke), or an activation of an audible and/or visible signal, prior to the performance of any maintenance to which such overt indication or signal is relevant under the provisions of this section. ( iii ) The OBD system of a durability data vehicle representing any test group certifying fully to the Federal OBD requirements as specified in \u00a7 86.1806-01(a) through (h) has specifically detected the problem and has illuminated the malfunction indicator light. ( 3 ) Emission measurement may not be used as a means of determining the need for unscheduled maintenance under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, except under the following conditions: ( i ) The Administrator may approve unscheduled maintenance on durability data vehicles based upon a significant change in emission levels that indicates a vehicle or engine malfunction. In these cases the Administrator may first approve specific diagnostic procedures to identify the source of the problem. The Administrator may further approve of specific corrections to the problem after the problem has been identified. The Administrator may only approve the corrective action after it is determined that: ( A ) The malfunction was caused by nonproduction build practices or by a previously undetected design problem; ( B ) The malfunction will not occur in production vehicles or engines in use; and ( C ) The deterioration factor generated by the durability data vehicle or engine will remain unaffected by the malfunction or by the corrective action (e.g., the malfunction was present for only a short period of time before detection, replacement parts are functionally representative of the proper mileage or hours, etc.). ( ii ) Following any unscheduled maintenance approved under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the manufacturer shall perform an after-maintenance emission test. If the Administrator determines that the after-maintenance emission levels for any pollutant indicates that the deterioration factor is no longer representative of production, the Administrator may disqualify the durability data vehicle or engine. ( 4 ) If a part failure or system malfunction occurrence and/or repair has rendered the vehicle/engine unrepresentative of vehicles in use, the vehicle/engine shall not be used for determining deterioration factors. ( 5 ) Repairs to vehicle components of a durability data vehicle other than the engine, emission control system, or fuel system, shall be performed only as a result of part failure, vehicle system malfunction, or with the advance approval of the Administrator. ( e ) Maintenance on emission data vehicles and engines. ( 1 ) Adjustment of engine idle speed on emission data vehicles may be performed once before the low-mileage/low-hour emission test point. Any other engine, emission control system, or fuel system adjustment, repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or replacement on emission data vehicles shall be performed only with the advance approval of the Administrator. ( 2 ) Repairs to vehicle components of an emission data vehicle other than the engine, emission control system, or fuel system, shall be performed only as a result of part failure, vehicle system malfunction, or with the advance approval of the Administrator. ( f ) Equipment, instruments, or tools may not be used to identify malfunctioning, maladjusted, or defective engine components unless the same or equivalent equipment, instruments, or tools will be available to dealerships and other service outlets and: ( 1 ) Are used in conjunction with scheduled maintenance on such components; or ( 2 ) Are used subsequent to the identification of a vehicle or engine malfunction, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for durability data vehicles or in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for emission data vehicles; or ( 3 ) Unless specifically authorized by the Administrator. ( g ) Complete emission tests (see \u00a7\u00a7 86.106-96 through 86.145-82 ) are required, unless waived by the Administrator, before and after scheduled maintenance approved for durability data vehicles. The manufacturer may perform emission tests before unscheduled maintenance. Complete emission tests are required after unscheduled maintenance which may reasonably be expected to affect emissions. The Administrator may waive the requirement to test after unscheduled maintenance. These test data may be submitted weekly to the Administrator, but shall be air posted or delivered within 7 days after completion of the tests, along with a complete record of all pertinent maintenance, including a preliminary engineering report of any malfunction diagnosis and the corrective action taken. A complete engineering report shall be delivered to the Administrator concurrently with the manufacturer's application for certification. ( h ) When air conditioning exhaust emission tests are required, the manufacturer must document that the vehicle's air conditioning system is operating properly and in a representative condition. Required air conditioning system maintenance is performed as unscheduled maintenance and does not require the Administrator's approval. [ 64 FR 23925 , May 4, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 59975 , Oct. 6, 2000; 70 FR 40443 , July 13, 2005; 79 FR 46372 , Aug. 8, 2014; 89 FR 28178 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1835-01 Confirmatory certification testing. ( a ) Testing by the Administrator. ( 1 ) The Administrator may require that any one or more of the test vehicles be submitted to the Agency, at such place or places as the Agency may designate, for the purposes of conducting emissions tests. The Administrator may specify that such testing be conducted at the manufacturer's facility, in which case instrumentation and equipment specified by the Administrator shall be made available by the manufacturer for test operations. Any testing conducted at a manufacturer's facility pursuant to this paragraph shall be scheduled by the manufacturer as promptly as possible. ( i ) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any adjustable parameter of an emission-data vehicle which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing in accordance with \u00a7 86.1833-01(a)(1) , to any setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with \u00a7 86.1833-01(a)(3) , prior to the performance of any tests to determine whether such vehicle or engine conforms to applicable emission standards, including tests performed by the manufacturer. However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to a setting which causes a higher engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter on the engine before it accumulated any dynamometer service, all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. The Administrator, in making or specifying such adjustments, will consider the effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will occur on in-use light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, or complete heavy-duty vehicles. In determining likelihood, the Administrator will consider factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on vehicle performance characteristics and surveillance information from similar in-use vehicles. ( ii ) For those vehicles parameters which the Administrator has not determined to be subject to adjustment during testing in accordance with \u00a7 86.1833-01(a)(1) , the vehicle presented to the Administrator for testing shall be calibrated within the production tolerances applicable to the manufacturer's specifications to be shown on the vehicle label (see \u00a7 86.1807-01 ) as specified in the application for certification. If the Administrator determines that a vehicle is not within such tolerances, the vehicle will be adjusted, at the facility designated by the Administrator, prior to the test and an engineering report shall be submitted to the Administrator describing the corrective action taken. Based on the engineering report, the Administrator will determine if the vehicle will be used as an emission data vehicle. ( 2 ) If the Administrator determines that the test data developed on an emission data vehicle under paragraph (a)(1) of this section would cause that vehicle to fail under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1841-01 , then the following procedure shall be observed: ( i ) The manufacturer may request a retest. Before the retest, those vehicle or engine parameters which the Administrator has not determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing in accordance with \u00a7 86.1833-01(a)(1) may be readjusted to manufacturer's specification, if these adjustments were made incorrectly prior to the first test. The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment to any setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with \u00a7 86.1833-01(a)(3) . Other maintenance or repairs may be performed in accordance with \u00a7 86.1834-01 . All work on the vehicle shall be done at such location and under such conditions as the Administrator may prescribe. ( ii ) The vehicle will be retested by the Administrator and the results of this test shall comprise the official data for the emission-data vehicle. ( 3 ) If sufficient durability data are not available at the time of any emission test conducted under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to enable the Administrator to determine whether an emission-data vehicle would fail, the manufacturer may request a retest in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If the manufacturer does not promptly make such request, he shall be deemed to have waived the right to a retest. A request for retest must be made before the manufacturer removes the vehicle from the test premises. ( 4 ) Retesting for fuel economy reasons or for compliance with greenhouse gas exhaust emission standards in \u00a7 86.1818-12 may be conducted under the provisions of 40 CFR 600.008-08 . ( b ) Manufacturer-conducted confirmatory testing. ( 1 ) If the Administrator determines not to conduct a confirmatory test under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, manufacturers will conduct a confirmatory test at their facility after submitting the original test data to the Administrator under either of the following circumstances: ( i ) The vehicle configuration has previously failed an emission standard. ( ii ) The test exhibits high emission levels determined by exceeding a percentage of the standards specified by the Administrator for that model year. ( 2 ) If the Administrator selects the vehicle for confirmatory testing based on the manufacturer's original test results, the testing shall be conducted as ordered by the Administrator. In this case, the manufacturer-conducted confirmatory testing specified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section would not be required. ( 3 ) For light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles the manufacturer shall conduct a retest of the FTP or highway test if the difference between the fuel economy of the confirmatory test and the original manufacturer's test equals or exceeds three percent (or such lower percentage to be applied consistently to all manufacturer conducted confirmatory testing as requested by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator). ( i ) For use in the fuel economy and exhaust greenhouse gas fleet averaging program described in 40 CFR parts 86 and 600 , the manufacturer may, in lieu of conducting a retest, accept as official the lower of the original and confirmatory test fuel economy results, and by doing so will also accept as official the calculated CREE value associated with the lower fuel economy test results. ( ii ) The manufacturer shall conduct a second retest of the FTP or highway test if the fuel economy difference between the second confirmatory test and the original manufacturer test equals or exceeds three percent (or such lower percentage as requested by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator) and the fuel economy difference between the second confirmatory test and the first confirmatory test equals or exceeds three percent (or such lower percentage as requested by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator). In lieu of conducting a second retest, the manufacturer may accept as official (for use in the fuel economy program and the exhaust greenhouse gas fleet averaging program) the lowest fuel economy of the original test, the first confirmatory test, and the second confirmatory test fuel economy results, and by doing so will also accept as official the calculated CREE value associated with the lowest fuel economy test results. ( c ) Official test determination. ( 1 ) Whenever the Administrator or the manufacturer conducts a confirmatory test segment on a test vehicle, the results of that test segment, unless subsequently invalidated by the Administrator, shall comprise the official data for that test segment for the vehicle at the prescribed test point and the manufacturer's original test data for that test segment for that prescribed test point shall not be used in determining compliance with emission standards. ( i ) If the Administrator or the manufacturer conducts more than one passing, valid, confirmatory test, the results from the first passing, valid confirmatory test shall be considered official and used in determining compliance with emission standards. ( ii ) Official test results for fuel economy and exhaust CO 2 emission purposes are determined in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 600.008-08 of this chapter . ( iii ) The Administrator may stop a test after any evaporative test segment and use as official data any valid results obtained up to that point in the test, as described in subpart B of this part . ( 2 ) Whenever the Administrator or the manufacturer does not conduct a confirmatory test on a test vehicle at a test point, the manufacturer's original test data will be accepted as the official data for that point. ( i ) If the Administrator makes a determination based on testing under paragraph (a) of this section (or other appropriate correlation test data), that there is a lack of correlation between the manufacturer's test equipment or procedures and the test equipment or procedures used by the Administrator, no manufacturer's test data will be accepted for purposes of certification until the reasons for the lack of correlation are determined and the validity of the data is established by the manufacturer. ( ii ) If the Administrator has reasonable basis to believe that any test data submitted by the manufacturer is not accurate or has been obtained in violation of any provisions of this subpart, the Administrator may refuse to accept that data as the official data pending retesting or submission of further information. ( iii ) If the manufacturer conducts more than one test on an emission data vehicle in the same configuration (excluding confirmatory tests run under paragraph (b) of this section), the data from the last test in that series of tests on that vehicle, will constitute the official data. ( d ) Conditional certification. Upon request of the manufacturer, the Administrator may issue a conditional certificate of conformity for a test group which has not completed the Administrator testing required under paragraph (a) of this section. Such a certificate will be issued based upon the conditions that the confirmatory testing be completed in an expedited manner and that the results of the testing are in compliance with all standards and procedures. ( 1 ) If, based on this testing or any other information, the Administrator later determines that the vehicles included in this test group do not meet the applicable standards, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer that the certificate is suspended. The certificate may be suspended in whole or in part as determined by the Administrator. Upon such a notification, the manufacturer must immediately cease the introduction of the affected vehicles into commerce. The manufacturer may request a hearing to appeal the Administrators decision using the provisions of \u00a7 86.1853-01 . ( 2 ) Production of vehicles by a manufacturer under the terms of this paragraph (d) will be deemed to be a consent to recall all vehicles in the test group which the Administrator determines do not meet applicable standards, and to cause such nonconformity to be remedied at no expense to the owner.

Any manufacturer obtaining certification under this subpart shall supply to the Administrator, upon request, a reasonable number of production vehicles selected by the Administrator which are representative of the engines, emission control systems, fuel systems, and transmission offered and typical of production models available for sale under the certificate. These vehicles shall be supplied for testing at such time and place and for such reasonable periods as the Administrator may require. \u00a7 86.1837-01 Rounding of emission measurements. ( a ) Unless otherwise specified, the results of all emission tests shall be rounded to the number of places to the right of the decimal point indicated by expressing the applicable emission standard of this subpart to one additional significant figure, in accordance with 40 CFR 1065.20 . ( b ) Fleet average NO X value calculations, where applicable, must be rounded before comparing with the applicable fleet average standard and calculating credits generated or needed as follows: manufacturers must round to the same number of significant figures that are contained in the quantity of vehicles in the denominator of the equation used to compute the fleet average NO X emissions, but to no less than one more decimal place than that of the applicable fleet average standard. [ 64 FR 23925 , May 4, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 6864 , Feb. 10, 2000; 79 FR 23728 , Apr. 28, 2014] \u00a7 86.1838-01 Small-volume manufacturer certification procedures. ( a ) Overview. The small-volume manufacturer certification procedures described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are optional. Small-volume manufacturers may use these optional procedures to demonstrate compliance with the general standards and specific emission requirements contained in this subpart. ( b ) Eligibility requirements \u2014 ( 1 ) Small-volume manufacturers. ( i ) Optional small-volume manufacturer certification procedures apply for vehicles produced by manufacturers with the following number of combined sales of vehicles subject to standards under this subpart in all states and territories of the United States in the model year for which certification is sought, including all vehicles and engines imported under the provisions of 40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509 : ( A ) At or below 5,000 units for the Tier 3 standards described in \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811-17 , 86.1813-17 , and 86.1816-18 and the Tier 4 standards described in \u00a7 86.1811-27 . This volume threshold applies for phasing in the Tier 3 and Tier 4 standards and for determining the corresponding deterioration factors. ( B ) No small-volume sales threshold applies for the heavy-duty greenhouse gas standards; alternative small-volume criteria apply as described in \u00a7 86.1819-14(k)(5) . ( C ) At or below 15,000 units for all other requirements. See \u00a7 86.1845 for separate provisions that apply for in-use testing. ( ii ) If a manufacturer's aggregated sales in the United States, as determined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are fewer than the number of units specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the manufacturer (or each manufacturer in the case of manufacturers in an aggregated relationship) may certify under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. ( iii ) A manufacturer that qualifies as a small business under the Small Business Administration regulations in 13 CFR part 121 is eligible for all the provisions that apply for small-volume manufacturers under this subpart. See \u00a7 86.1801-12(j) to determine whether companies qualify as small businesses. ( iv ) The sales volumes specified in this section are based on actual sales, unless otherwise specified. ( v ) Except for delayed implementation of new emission standards, an eligible manufacturer must transition out of the special provisions that apply for small-volume manufacturers as described in \u00a7 86.1801-12(k)(2)(i) through (iii) if sales volumes increase above the applicable threshold. ( 2 ) Small-volume test groups and small-volume monitor families. ( i ) If the aggregated sales in all states and territories of the United States, as determined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are equal to or greater than 15,000 units, then the manufacturer (or each manufacturer in the case of manufacturers in an aggregated relationship) will be allowed to certify a number of units under the small-volume test group certification procedures in accordance with the criteria identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section. Similarly, the manufacturer will be exempt from Part A testing for monitor accuracy as described in \u00a7 86.1845-04(g) in accordance with the criteria identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section for individual monitor families with aggregated sales up to 5,000 units in the current model year. ( ii ) If there are no additional manufacturers in an aggregated relationship meeting the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, then the manufacturer may certify whole test groups whose total aggregated sales (including heavy-duty engines) are less than 15,000 units using the small-volume provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. ( iii ) If there is an aggregated relationship with another manufacturer which satisfies the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, then the following provisions shall apply: ( A ) If none of the manufacturers own 50 percent or more of another manufacturer in the aggregated relationship, then each manufacturer may certify whole test groups whose total aggregated sales (including heavy-duty engines) are less than 15,000 units using the small-volume provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. ( B ) If any of the manufacturers own 50 percent or more of another manufacturer in the aggregated relationship, then the limit of 14,999 units must be shared among the manufacturers in such a relationship. In total for all the manufacturers involved in such a relationship, aggregated sales (including heavy-duty engines) of up to 14,999 units may be certified using the small-volume provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. Only whole test groups shall be eligible for small-volume status under paragraph (c) of this section. ( iv ) In the case of a joint venture arrangement (50/50 ownership) between two manufacturers, each manufacturer retains its eligibility for 14,999 units under the small-volume test group certification procedures, but the joint venture must draw its maximum 14,999 units from the units allocated to its parent manufacturers. Only whole test groups shall be eligible for small-volume status under paragraph (c) of this section. ( 3 ) Sales aggregation for related manufacturers. The projected or actual sales from different firms shall be aggregated in the following situations: ( i ) Vehicles and/or engines produced by two or more firms, one of which is 10 percent or greater part owned by another. ( ii ) Vehicles and/or engines produced by any two or more firms if a third party has equity ownership of 10 percent or more in each of the firms. ( iii ) Vehicles and/or engines produced by two or more firms having a common corporate officer(s) who is (are) responsible for the overall direction of the companies. ( iv ) Vehicles and/or engines imported or distributed by all firms where the vehicles and/or engines are manufactured by the same entity and the importer or distributor is an authorized agent of the entity. ( c ) Small-volume provisions. Small-volume manufacturers and small-volume test groups shall demonstrate compliance with all applicable sections of this subpart, with the following exceptions: ( 1 ) Durability demonstration. Use the provisions of \u00a7 86.1826 rather than the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 86.1823 , 86.1824 , and 86.1825 . ( 2 ) In-use verification testing. Measure emissions from in-use vehicles as described in \u00a7 86.1845 , subject to the following additional provisions: ( i ) In-use verification test vehicles may be procured from customers or may be owned by, or under the control of the manufacturer, provided that the vehicle has accumulated mileage in typical operation on public streets and has received typical maintenance. ( ii ) In lieu of procuring in-use verification test vehicles that have a minimum odometer reading of 50,000 miles, a manufacturer may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Agency that, based on owner survey data, the average mileage accumulated after 4 years for a given test group is less than 50,000 miles. The Agency may approve procurement of in-use verification test vehicles that have a lower minimum odometer reading based on such data. ( iii ) The provisions of \u00a7 86.1845-04(c)(2) that require one vehicle of each test group during high mileage in-use verification testing to have a minimum odometer mileage of 75 percent of the full useful life mileage do not apply. ( iv ) Manufacturers intending to use the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall submit to the Agency a plan detailing how these provisions will be met before submitting an application for certification for the subject vehicles. ( d ) Operationally independent manufacturers. Manufacturers may submit an application to EPA requesting treatment as an operationally independent manufacturer. A manufacturer that is granted operationally independent status may qualify for all the regulatory provisions of this subpart that apply for small-volume manufacturers on the basis of its own vehicle production and/or sales volumes, and would not require aggregation with related manufacturers. In this paragraph (d) , the term \u201crelated manufacturer(s)\u201d means manufacturers that would qualify for aggregation under the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. ( 1 ) To request consideration for operationally independent status, the manufacturer must submit an application demonstrating that the following criteria are met, and have been continuously met for at least two years prior to submitting the application to EPA. The application must be signed by the president or the chief executive officer of the manufacturer. ( i ) The applicant does not receive any financial or other means of support of economic value from any related manufacturers for purposes of vehicle design, vehicle parts procurement, research and development, and production facilities and operation. Any transactions with related manufacturers must be conducted under normal commercial arrangements like those conducted with other external parties. Any such transactions with related manufacturers shall be demonstrated to have been at competitive pricing rates to the applicant. ( ii ) The applicant maintains wholly separate and independent research and development, testing, and vehicle manufacturing and production facilities. ( iii ) The applicant does not use any vehicle engines, powertrains, or platforms developed or produced by related manufacturers. ( iv ) The applicant does not hold any patents jointly with related manufacturers. ( v ) The applicant maintains separate business administration, legal, purchasing, sales, and marketing departments as well as wholly autonomous decision making on all commercial matters. ( vi ) The Board of Directors of the applicant may not share more than 25 percent of its membership with any related manufacturer. No top operational management of the applicant may be shared with any related manufacturer, including the president, the chief executive officer (CEO), the chief financial officer (CFO), and the chief operating officer (COO). No individual director or combination of directors that is shared with a related manufacturer may exercise exclusive management control over either or both companies. ( vii ) Parts or components supply agreements between the applicant and related companies must be established through open market processes. An applicant that sells or otherwise provides parts and/or vehicle components to a manufacturer that is not a related manufacturer must do so through the open market at competitive pricing rates. ( 2 ) Manufacturers that have been granted operationally independent status must report any material changes to the information provided in the application within 60 days of the occurrence of the change. If such a change occurs that results in the manufacturer no longer meeting the requirements of the application, the manufacturer will lose the eligibility to be considered operationally independent. The EPA will confirm that the manufacturer no longer meets one or more of the criteria and thus is no longer considered operationally independent, and will notify the manufacturer of the change in status. A manufacturer who loses the eligibility for operationally independent status must transition to the appropriate emission standards no later than the third model year after the model year in which the loss of eligibility occurred. For example, a manufacturer that loses eligibility in their 2018 model year would be required to meet appropriate standards in the 2021 model year. A manufacturer that loses eligibility must meet the applicable criteria for three consecutive model years before they are allowed to apply for a reinstatement of their operationally independent status. ( 3 ) The manufacturer applying for operational independence shall engage an independent certified public accountant, or firm of such accountants (hereinafter referred to as \u201cCPA\u201d), to perform an agreed-upon procedures attestation engagement of the underlying documentation that forms the basis of the application as required in this paragraph (d) . ( i ) The CPA shall perform the attestation engagements in accordance with the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. ( ii ) The CPA may complete the requirements of this paragraph with the assistance of internal auditors who are employees or agents of the applicant, so long as such assistance is in accordance with the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. ( iii ) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, an applicant may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (d)(3) if the requirements of this paragraph (d)(3) are completed by an auditor who is an employee of the applicant, provided that such employee: ( A ) Is an internal auditor certified by the Institute of Internal Auditors, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cCIA\u201d); and ( B ) Completes the internal audits in accordance with the standards for internal auditing established by the Institute of Internal Auditors. ( iv ) Use of a CPA or CIA who is debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment pursuant to the Governmentwide Debarment and Suspension Regulations, 2 CFR part 1532 , or the Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility Provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4 , shall be deemed in noncompliance with the requirements of this section. [ 64 FR 23925 , May 4, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 6864 , Feb. 10, 2000; 67 FR 72826 , Dec. 6, 2002; 71 FR 2836 , Jan. 17, 2006; 77 FR 63162 , Oct. 15, 2012; 79 FR 23728 , Apr. 28, 2014; 81 FR 73991 , Oct. 25, 2016; 86 FR 34371 , June 29, 2021; 89 FR 28179 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1839-01 Carryover of certification and battery monitoring data. ( a ) In lieu of testing an emission-data or durability vehicle selected under \u00a7 86.1822 , \u00a7 86.1828 , or \u00a7 86.1829 , and submitting data therefrom, a manufacturer may submit exhaust emission data, evaporative emission data and/or refueling emission data, as applicable, on a similar vehicle for which certification has been obtained or for which all applicable data required under \u00a7 86.1845 has previously been submitted. To be eligible for this provision, the manufacturer must use good engineering judgment and meet the following criteria: ( 1 ) In the case of durability data, the manufacturer must determine that the previously generated durability data represent a worst case or equivalent rate of deterioration for all applicable emission constituents compared to the configuration selected for durability demonstration. Prior to certification, the Administrator may require the manufacturer to provide data showing that the distribution of catalyst temperatures of the selected durability configuration is effectively equivalent or lower than the distribution of catalyst temperatures of the vehicle configuration which is the source of the previously generated data. ( 2 ) In the case of emission data, the manufacturer must determine that the previously generated emissions data represent a worst case or equivalent level of emissions for all applicable emission constituents compared to the configuration selected for emission compliance demonstration. ( b ) In lieu of using newly aged hardware on an EDV as allowed under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1823-08(f)(2) , a manufacturer may use similar hardware aged for an EDV previously submitted, provided that the manufacturer determines that the previously aged hardware represents a worst case or equivalent rate of deterioration for all applicable emission constituents for durability demonstration. ( c ) In lieu of testing battery electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles for monitor accuracy under \u00a7 86.1822-01(a) and submitting the test data, a manufacturer may rely on previously conducted testing on a similar vehicle for which such test data have previously been submitted to demonstrate compliance with monitor accuracy requirements. For vehicles to be eligible for this provision, they must have designs for battery monitoring that are identical in all material respects to the vehicles tested under \u00a7 86.1845-04(g) . If a monitor family fails to meet accuracy requirements, repeat the testing under \u00a7 86.1845-04(g) as soon as practicable. [ 89 FR 28180 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1840-01 Special test procedures. Provisions for special test procedures apply as described in 40 CFR 1065.10 and 1066.10 . For example, manufacturers must propose a procedure for EPA's review and advance approval for testing and certifying vehicles equipped with periodically regenerating aftertreatment devices, including sufficient documentation and data for EPA to fully evaluate the request. [ 89 FR 28180 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1841-01 Compliance with emission standards for the purpose of certification. ( a ) Certification levels of a test vehicle will be calculated for each emission constituent applicable to the test group for both full and intermediate useful life as appropriate. ( 1 ) If the durability demonstration procedure used by the manufacturer under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1823 , \u00a7 86.1824 , or \u00a7 86.1825 requires a DF to be calculated, the DF shall be applied to the official test results determined in \u00a7 86.1835-01(c) for each regulated emission constituent and for full and intermediate useful life, as appropriate, using the following procedures: ( i ) For additive DF's, the DF will be added to the emission result. The sum will be rounded to the same level of precision as the standard for the constituent at full and/or intermediate useful life, as appropriate. This rounded sum is the certification level for that emission constituent and for that useful life mileage. ( ii ) For multiplicative DFs, the DF will be multiplied by the emission result for each regulated constituent. The product will be rounded to the same level of precision as the standard for the constituent at full and intermediate useful life, as appropriate. This rounded product is the certification level for that emission constituent and for that useful life mileage. ( iii ) For a composite standard of NMHC+NO X , the measured results of NMHC and NO X must each be adjusted by their corresponding deterioration factors before the composite NMHC+NO X certification level is calculated. Where the applicable FTP exhaust hydrocarbon emission standard is an NMOG standard, the applicable NMOG deterioration factor must be used in place of the NMHC deterioration factor, unless otherwise approved by the Administrator. ( 2 ) If the durability demonstration procedure used by the manufacturer under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1823 , \u00a7 86.1824 , or \u00a7 86.1825 , as applicable, requires testing of the EDV with aged emission components, the official results of that testing determined under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1835-01(c) shall be rounded to the same level of precision as the standard for each regulated constituent at full and intermediate useful life, as appropriate. This rounded emission value is the certification level for that emission constituent at that useful life mileage. ( 3 ) Compliance with full useful life CO 2 exhaust emission standards shall be demonstrated at certification by the certification levels on the duty cycles specified for carbon-related exhaust emissions according to \u00a7 600.113 of this chapter . ( 4 ) The rounding required in paragraph (a) of this section shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 86.1837-01 . ( b ) To be considered in compliance with the standards for the purposes of certification, the certification levels for the test vehicle calculated in paragraph (a) of this section shall be less than or equal to the standards for all emission constituents to which the test group is subject, at both full and intermediate useful life as appropriate for that test group. ( c ) Every test vehicle of a test group must comply with all applicable exhaust emission standards before that test group may be certified. ( d ) Every test vehicle of an evaporative/refueling family must comply with all applicable evaporative and/or refueling emission standards before that family may be certified. ( e ) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, manufacturers must not use Reactivity Adjustment Factors (RAFs) in their calculation of the certification level of any pollutant for any vehicle. [ 64 FR 23925 , May 4, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 6864 , Feb. 10, 2000; 66 FR 19310 , Apr. 13, 2001; 71 FR 2836 , Jan. 17, 2006; 75 FR 25690 , May 7, 2010; 76 FR 39522 , July 6, 2011; 89 FR 28180 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1842-01 Addition of a vehicle after certification; and changes to a vehicle covered by certification. ( a ) Addition of a car line after certification. ( 1 ) If a manufacturer proposes to add to its product line a new car line of the same test group as vehicles previously certified but which was not described in the application for certification when the test vehicle(s) representing other vehicles of that combination was certified, it shall notify the Administrator. This notification shall include a full description of the vehicle to be added. ( 2 ) The manufacturer shall perform such tests on the test vehicle(s) representing the vehicle to be added which would have been required if the vehicle had been included in the original application for certification. ( 3 ) If, after a review of the test reports and data submitted by the manufacturer, and data derived from any testing conducted under \u00a7 86.1835-01 , the Administrator determines that the test vehicle(s) or test engine(s) meets all applicable standards, the appropriate certificate will be amended accordingly. If the Administrator determines that the test vehicle(s) does not meet applicable standards, she/he will proceed under \u00a7 86.1850-01 . ( b ) Changes to the configuration of vehicles covered by a Certificate of Conformity. ( 1 ) A manufacturer will notify the Administrator concurrently with (or in advance of) any change or addition in production vehicles which creates a new vehicle configuration within the car lines covered in a certified test group, giving a full description of the change. Such a change is referred to as a running change. Upon notification, the manufacturer may begin production of the running change if the manufacturer determines that following the change all affected vehicles will still meet the applicable emission standards. ( i ) Such notification shall include a full description of the addition or change and any supporting documentation the manufacturer may desire to include to support the manufacturer's determination in accordance with \u00a7 86.1844-01 . ( ii ) The manufacturer's determination that the addition or change does not cause noncompliance shall be based on an engineering evaluation of the addition or change and/or testing. ( 2 ) The Administrator may require that additional emission testing be performed to support the manufacturer's determination submitted in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If additional testing is required the Administrator shall proceed in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Additional test data, if requested, must be provided within 30 days of the request or the manufacturer must rescind the addition or change immediately. The Administrator may grant additional time to complete testing. If based on this additional testing or any other information, the Administrator determines that the vehicles affected by the addition or change do not meet the applicable standards the Administrator will notify the manufacturer to rescind the addition or change immediately upon receipt of the notification. ( c ) Election to produce vehicles under this section will be deemed to be a consent to recall all vehicles which the Administrator determines under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section do not meet applicable standards, and to cause such nonconformity to be remedied at no expense to the owner. \u00a7 86.1843-01 General information requirements.

[ 64 FR 23925 , May 4, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 6865 , Feb. 10, 2000; 65 FR 59976 , Oct. 6, 2000; 71 FR 2837 , Jan. 17, 2006; 71 FR 51489 , Aug. 30, 2006; 72 FR 8566 , Feb. 26, 2007; 75 FR 66457 , Oct. 28, 2010; 76 FR 57378 , Sept. 15, 2011; 78 FR 36388 , June 17, 2013; 79 FR 23730 , Apr. 28, 2014; 80 FR 9109 , Feb. 19, 2015; 81 FR 73991 , Oct. 25, 2016; 89 FR 28181 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1845-04 Manufacturer in-use verification testing requirements. ( a ) General requirements. ( 1 ) Manufacturers of LDV, LDT, MDPV and complete HDV must test, or cause to have tested, a specified number of vehicles. Such testing must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this section. ( 2 ) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, no emission measurements made under the requirements of this section may be adjusted by Reactivity Adjustment Factors (RAFs). ( 3 ) The following provisions apply regarding the possibility of residual effects from varying fuel sulfur levels: ( i ) Vehicles certified under \u00a7 86.1811 must always measure emissions over the FTP, then over the HFET (if applicable), then over the US06. If a vehicle meets all the applicable emission standards except the FTP or HFET emission standard for NMOG+NO X , and a fuel sample from the tested vehicle (representing the as-received condition) has a measured fuel sulfur level exceeding 15 ppm when measured as described in 40 CFR 1065.710 , the manufacturer may repeat the FTP and HFET measurements and use the new emission values as the official results for that vehicle. For all other cases, measured emission levels from the first test will be considered the official results for the test vehicle, regardless of any test results from additional test runs. Where repeat testing is allowed, the vehicle may operate for up to two US06 cycles (with or without measurement) before repeating the FTP and HFET measurements. The repeat measurements must include both FTP and HFET, even if the vehicle failed only one of those tests, unless the HFET is not required for a particular vehicle. Vehicles may not undergo any other vehicle preconditioning to eliminate fuel sulfur effects on the emission control system, unless we approve it in advance. This paragraph (a)(3)(i) does not apply for Tier 2 vehicles. ( ii ) Upon a manufacturer's written request, prior to in-use testing, that presents information to EPA regarding pre-conditioning procedures designed solely to remove the effects of high sulfur in gasoline from vehicles produced through the 2007 model year, EPA will consider allowing such procedures on a case-by-case basis. EPA's decision will apply to manufacturer in-use testing conducted under this section and to any in-use testing conducted by EPA. Such procedures are not available for complete HDV. For model year 2007 and later Tier 2 vehicles, this provision can be used only in American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and then only if low sulfur gasoline is determined by the Administrator to be unavailable in that specific location. ( 4 ) Battery-related in-use testing requirements apply for battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as described in paragraph (g) of this section. ( 5 ) Certain medium-duty vehicles are also subject to in-use testing requirements to demonstrate compliance with off-cycle emission standards as described in paragraph (h) of this section. ( b ) Low-mileage testing \u2014 ( 1 ) Test groups. Testing must be conducted for each test group and evaporative/refueling family as specified. ( 2 ) Vehicle mileage. All test vehicles must have a minimum odometer mileage of 10,000 miles. ( 3 ) Procuring test vehicles. For each test group, the minimum number of vehicles that must be tested is specified in table 1 (Table S04-06) and table 2 (Table S04-07) to this paragraph (b)(3) . After testing the minimum number of vehicles of a specific test group as specified in Table S04-06 or S04-07, a manufacturer may test additional vehicles upon request and approval by the Agency prior to the initiation of the additional testing. Any additional testing must be completed within the testing completion requirements shown in \u00a7 86.1845-04(b)(4) . The request and Agency approval (if any) shall apply to test groups on a case-by-case basis and apply only to testing under this paragraph (b) . Separate approval will be required to test additional vehicles under paragraph (c) of this section. In addition to any testing that is required under Table S04-06 and Table S04-07, a manufacturer shall test one vehicle from each evaporative/refueling family for evaporative/refueling emissions. If a manufacturer believes it is unable to procure the required number of test vehicles meeting the specifications of this section, the manufacturer may request Administrator approval to either test a smaller number of vehicles or include vehicles that don't fully meet specifications. The request shall include a description of the methods the manufacturer has used to procure the required number of vehicles meeting specifications. The approval of any such request will be based on a review of the procurement efforts made by the manufacturer to determine if all reasonable steps have been taken to procure the required number of test vehicles meeting the specifications of this section.

( 4 ) Completion of testing. Testing of the vehicles in a test group and evaporative/refueling family must be completed within 12 months of the end of production of that test group (or evaporative/refueling family) for that model year or a later date that we approve. ( 5 ) Testing. ( i ) Each test vehicle of a test group shall be tested in accordance with the FTP and the US06 as described in subpart B of this part , when such test vehicle is tested for compliance with applicable exhaust emission standards under this subpart. Test vehicles subject to applicable exhaust CO 2 emission standards under this subpart shall also be tested in accordance with the HFET as described in 40 CFR 1066.840 . ( ii ) For vehicles subject to Tier 3 p.m. standards, manufacturers must measure PM emissions over the FTP and US06 driving schedules for at least 50 percent of the vehicles tested under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section. For vehicles subject to Tier 4 p.m. standards, this test rate increases to 100 percent. ( iii ) Starting with model year 2018 vehicles, manufacturers must demonstrate compliance with the Tier 3 leak standard specified in \u00a7 86.1813 , if applicable, as described in this paragraph (b)(5)(iii) . Manufacturers must evaluate each vehicle tested under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, except that leak testing is not required for vehicles tested under paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section for diurnal emissions. In addition, manufacturers must evaluate at least one vehicle from each leak family for a given model year. Manufacturers may rely on OBD monitoring instead of testing as follows: ( A ) A vehicle is considered to pass the leak test if the OBD system completed a leak check within the previous 750 miles of driving without showing a leak fault code. ( B ) Whether or not a vehicle's OBD system has completed a leak check within the previous 750 miles of driving, the manufacturer may operate the vehicle as needed to force the OBD system to perform a leak check. If the OBD leak check does not show a leak fault, the vehicle is considered to pass the leak test. ( C ) If the most recent OBD leak check from paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section shows a leak-related fault code, the vehicle is presumed to have failed the leak test. Manufacturers may perform the leak measurement procedure described in 40 CFR 1066.985 for an official result to replace the finding from the OBD leak check. ( D ) Manufacturers may not perform repeat OBD checks or leak measurements to over-ride a failure under paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(C) of this section. ( iv ) For vehicles other than gaseous-fueled vehicles and electric vehicles, one test vehicle of each evaporative/refueling family shall be tested in accordance with the supplemental 2-diurnal-plus-hot-soak evaporative emission and refueling emission procedures described in subpart B of this part , when such test vehicle is tested for compliance with applicable evaporative emission and refueling standards under this subpart. For gaseous-fueled vehicles, one test vehicle of each evaporative/refueling family shall be tested in accordance with the 3-diurnal-plus-hot-soak evaporative emission and refueling emission procedures described in subpart B of this part , when such test vehicle is tested for compliance with applicable evaporative emission and refueling standards under this subpart. The test vehicles tested to fulfill the evaporative/refueling testing requirement of this paragraph (b)(5)(iv) will be counted when determining compliance with the minimum number of vehicles as specified in Table S04-06 and Table S04-07 (tables 1 and 2 to paragraph (b)(3) of this section) for testing under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section only if the vehicle is also tested for exhaust emissions under the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section. ( 6 ) Test condition. Each test vehicle not rejected based on the criteria specified in appendix II to this subpart shall be tested in as-received condition. ( 7 ) Diagnostic maintenance. A manufacturer may conduct subsequent diagnostic maintenance and/or testing of any vehicle. Any such maintenance and/or testing shall be reported to the Agency as specified in \u00a7 86.1847 . ( c ) High-mileage testing \u2014 ( 1 ) Test groups. Testing must be conducted for each test group and evaporative/refueling family as specified. ( 2 ) Vehicle mileage. All test vehicles must have a minimum odometer mileage of 50,000 miles. At least one vehicle of each test group must have a minimum odometer mileage of 105,000 miles or 75 percent of the full useful life mileage, whichever is less. See \u00a7 86.1838-01(c)(2) for small-volume manufacturer mileage requirements. ( 3 ) Procuring test vehicles. For each test group, the minimum number of vehicles that must be tested is specified in Table S04-06 and Table S04-07 (tables 1 and 2 to paragraph (b)(3) of this section). After testing the minimum number of vehicles of a specific test group as specified in Table S04-06 and Table S04-07, a manufacturer may test additional vehicles upon request and approval by the Agency prior to the initiation of the additional testing. Any additional testing must be completed within the testing completion requirements shown in \u00a7 86.1845-04(c)(4) . The request and Agency approval (if any) shall apply to test groups on a case-by-case basis and apply only to testing under this paragraph (c) . In addition to any testing that is required under Table S04-06 and Table S04-07, a manufacturer shall test one vehicle from each evaporative/refueling family for evaporative/refueling emissions. If a manufacturer believes it is unable to procure the required number of test vehicles meeting the specifications of this section, the manufacturer may request Administrator approval to either test a smaller number of vehicles or include vehicles that don't fully meet specifications. The request shall include a description of the methods the manufacturer has used to procure the required number of vehicles meeting specifications. The approval of any such request will be based on a review of the procurement efforts made by the manufacturer to determine if all reasonable steps have been taken to procure the required number of test vehicles meeting the specifications of this section. ( 4 ) Initiation and completion of testing. Testing of a test group (or evaporative refueling family) must commence within 4 years of the end of production of the test group (or evaporative/refueling family) and be completed within 5 years of the end of production of the test group (or evaporative/refueling family) or a later date that we approve. ( 5 ) Testing. ( i ) Each test vehicle shall be tested in accordance with the FTP and the US06 as described in subpart B of this part when such test vehicle is tested for compliance with applicable exhaust emission standards under this subpart. Test vehicles subject to applicable exhaust CO 2 emission standards under this subpart shall also be tested in accordance with the HFET as described in 40 CFR 1066.840 . One test vehicle from each test group shall be tested over the FTP at high altitude. The test vehicle tested at high altitude is not required to be one of the same test vehicles tested at low altitude. The test vehicle tested at high altitude is counted when determining the compliance with the requirements shown in Table S04-06 and Table S04-07 (tables 1 and 2 to paragraph (b)(3) of this section) or the expanded sample size as provided for in this paragraph (c) . ( ii ) For vehicles subject to Tier 3 p.m. standards, manufacturers must measure PM emissions over the FTP and US06 driving schedules for at least 50 percent of the vehicles tested under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section. For vehicles subject to Tier 4 p.m. standards, this test rate increases to 100 percent. ( iii ) Starting with model year 2018 vehicles, manufacturers must evaluate each vehicle tested under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section to demonstrate compliance with the Tier 3 leak standard specified in \u00a7 86.1813 , except that leak testing is not required for vehicles tested under paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section for diurnal emissions. In addition, manufacturers must evaluate at least one vehicle from each leak family for a given model year. Manufacturers may rely on OBD monitoring instead of testing as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section. ( iv ) For vehicles other than gaseous-fueled vehicles and electric vehicles, one test vehicle of each evaporative/refueling family shall be tested in accordance with the supplemental 2-diurnal-plus-hot-soak evaporative emission procedures described in subpart B of this part , when such test vehicle is tested for compliance with applicable evaporative emission and refueling standards under this subpart. For gaseous-fueled vehicles, one test vehicle of each evaporative/refueling family shall be tested in accordance with the 3-diurnal-plus-hot-soak evaporative emission procedures described in subpart B of this part , when such test vehicle is tested for compliance with applicable evaporative emission and refueling standards under this subpart. The vehicles tested to fulfill the evaporative/refueling testing requirement of this paragraph (c)(5)(iv) will be counted when determining compliance with the minimum number of vehicles as specified in Tables S04-06 and S04-07 (tables 1 and 2 to paragraph (b)(3) of this section) for testing under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section only if the vehicle is also tested for exhaust emissions under the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section . ( 6 ) Test condition. Each test vehicle not rejected based on the criteria specified in appendix II to this subpart shall be tested in as-received condition. ( 7 ) Diagnostic maintenance. A manufacturer may conduct subsequent diagnostic maintenance and/or testing on any vehicle. Any such maintenance and/or testing shall be reported to the Agency as specified in \u00a7 86.1847-01 . ( d ) Test vehicle procurement. Vehicles tested under this section shall be procured as follows: ( 1 ) Vehicle ownership. Vehicles shall be procured from the group of persons who own or lease vehicles registered in the procurement area. Vehicles shall be procured from persons which own or lease the vehicle, excluding commercial owners/lessees owned or controlled by the vehicle manufacturer, using the procedures described in appendix I to this subpart. See \u00a7 86.1838-01(c)(2)(i) for small volume manufacturer requirements. ( 2 ) Geographical limitations. ( i ) Test groups certified to 50-state standards: For low altitude testing no more than fifty percent of the test vehicles may be procured from California. The test vehicles procured from the 49-state area must be procured from a location with a heating degree day 30-year annual average equal to or greater than 4,000. ( ii ) Test groups certified to 49-state standards: The test vehicles procured from the 49-state area must be procured from a location with a heating degree day 30-year annual average equal to or greater than 4,000. ( iii ) Vehicles procured for high altitude testing may be procured from any area located above 4,000 feet. ( 3 ) Rejecting candidate vehicles. Vehicles may be rejected for procurement or testing under this section if they meet one or more of the rejection criteria in appendix II to this subpart. Vehicles may also be rejected after testing under this section if they meet one or more of the rejection criteria in appendix II to this subpart. Any vehicle rejected after testing must be replaced in order that the number of test vehicles in the sample comply with the sample size requirements of this section. Any post-test vehicle rejection and replacement procurement and testing must take place within the testing completion requirements of this section. ( e ) Testing facilities, procedures, quality assurance and quality control \u2014 ( 1 ) Lab equipment and procedural requirements. The manufacturer shall utilize a test laboratory that is in accordance with the equipment and procedural requirements of subpart B of this part to conduct the testing required by this section. ( 2 ) Notification of test facility. The manufacturer shall notify the Agency of the name and location of the testing laboratory(s) to be used to conduct testing of vehicles of each model year conducted pursuant to this section. Such notification shall occur at least thirty working days prior to the initiation of testing of the vehicles of that model year. ( 3 ) Correlation. The manufacturer shall document correlation traceable to the Environmental Protection Agency's National Vehicle and Fuel Emission Laboratory for its test laboratory utilized to conduct the testing required by this section. ( f ) NMOG and formaldehyde. The following provisions apply for measuring NMOG and formaldehyde: ( 1 ) A manufacturer must conduct in-use testing on a test group by determining NMOG exhaust emissions using the same methodology used for certification, as described in 40 CFR 1066.635 . ( 2 ) For flexible-fueled vehicles certified to NMOG (or NMOG+NO X ) standards, the manufacturer may ask for EPA approval to demonstrate compliance using an equivalent NMOG emission result calculated from a ratio of ethanol NMOG exhaust emissions to gasoline NMHC exhaust emissions. Ethanol NMOG exhaust emissions are measured values from testing with the ethanol test fuel, expressed as NMOG. Gasoline NMHC exhaust emissions are measured values from testing with the gasoline test fuel, expressed as NMHC. This ratio must be established during certification for each emission-data vehicle for the applicable test group. Use good engineering judgment to establish a different ratio for each duty cycle or test interval as appropriate. Identify the ratio values you develop under this paragraph (f)(2) and describe the duty cycle or test interval to which they apply in the Part II application for certification. Calculate the equivalent NMOG emission result by multiplying the measured gasoline NMHC exhaust emissions for a given duty cycle or test interval by the appropriate ratio. ( 3 ) If the manufacturer measures NMOG as described in 40 CFR 1066.635(a) , it must also measure and report HCHO emissions. As an alternative to measuring the HCHO content, if the manufacturer measures NMOG as permitted in 40 CFR 1066.635(c) , the Administrator may approve, upon submission of supporting data by a manufacturer, the use of HCHO to NMHC ratios. To request the use of HCHO to NMHC ratios, the manufacturer must establish during certification testing the ratio of measured HCHO exhaust emissions to measured NMHC exhaust emissions for each emission-data vehicle for the applicable test group. The results must be submitted to the Administrator with the Part II application for certification. Following approval of the application for certification, the manufacturer may conduct in-use testing on the test group by measuring NMHC exhaust emissions rather than HCHO exhaust emissions. The measured NMHC exhaust emissions must be multiplied by the HCHO to NMHC ratio submitted in the application for certification for the test group to determine the equivalent HCHO exhaust emission values for the test vehicle. The equivalent HCHO exhaust emission values must be compared to the HCHO exhaust emission standard applicable to the test group. ( g ) Battery testing. Manufacturers of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles must perform in-use testing related to battery monitor accuracy and battery durability for those vehicles as described in \u00a7 86.1815-27 . Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 86.1815-27(h) , perform Part A testing for each monitor family as follows to verify that SOCE monitors meet accuracy requirements: ( 1 ) Determine accuracy by measuring SOCE from in-use vehicles using the procedures specified in \u00a7 86.1815-27(c) and comparing the measured values to the SOCE value displayed on the monitor at the start of testing. ( 2 ) Perform low-mileage testing of the vehicles in a monitor family within 24 months of the end of production of that monitor family for that model year. All test vehicles must have a minimum odometer mileage of 20,000 miles. ( 3 ) Perform high-mileage testing of the vehicles in a monitor family by starting the test program within 4 years of the end of production of the monitor family and completing the test program within 5 years of the end of production of the monitor family. All test vehicles must have a minimum odometer mileage of 40,000 miles. ( 4 ) Select test vehicles as described in paragraphs (b)(6) , (c)(6) , and (d)(1) and (3) of this section from the United States. Send notification regarding test location as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. ( 5 ) You may perform diagnostic maintenance as specified in paragraph (b)(7) and (c)(7) of this section. ( 6 ) See \u00a7 86.1838-01(b)(2) for a testing exemption that applies for small-volume monitor families. ( h ) Off-cycle testing for high-GCWR medium-duty vehicles. Medium-duty vehicles that are subject to off-cycle standards under \u00a7 86.1811-27(e) are subject to in-use testing requirements described in 40 CFR part 1036, subpart E , and 40 CFR 1036.530, with the following exceptions and clarifications: ( 1 ) In-use testing requirements apply for both vehicles with spark-ignition engines and vehicles with compression-ignition engines. ( 2 ) References to \u201cengine family\u201d should be understood to mean \u201ctest group\u201d. ( 3 ) In our test order we may include the following requirements and specifications: ( i ) We may select any vehicle configuration for testing. We may also specify that the selected vehicle have certain optional features. ( ii ) We may allow the vehicle manufacturer to arrange for the driver of a test vehicle to be an employee or a hired contractor, rather than the vehicle owner. ( iii ) We may specify certain routes or types of driving. ( 4 ) Within 45 days after we direct you to perform testing under this paragraph (h) , send us a proposed test plan that meets the provisions in this paragraph (h)(4) in addition to what we specify in 40 CFR 1036.410 . EPA must approve the test plan before the manufacturer may start testing. EPA approval will be based on a determination that the test plan meets all applicable requirements. The test plan must include the following information: ( i ) Describe how you will select vehicles, including consideration of available options and features, to properly represent in-use performance for the selected vehicle configuration. ( ii ) Describe any planned inspection or maintenance before testing the vehicle, along with any criteria for rejecting a candidate vehicle. ( iii ) Describe test routes planned for testing. The test route must target a specific total duration or distance, including at least three hours of driving with non-idle engine operation. The test route must represent normal driving, including a broad range of vehicle speeds and accelerations and a reasonable amount of operation at varying grades. If the completed test route does not include enough windows for any bin as specified in paragraph (h)(8) of this section, repeat the drive over the approved test route. ( iv ) Describe your plan for vehicle operation to include at least 50 percent of non-idle operation with gross combined weight at least 70 percent of GCWR. Trailers used for testing must meet certain specifications as follows: ( A ) Trailers must comply with requirements in Row D through Row L of Table 1 of SAE J2807 (incorporated by reference, see \u00a7 86.1 ); however, the frontal area of the trailer may not exceed the vehicle manufacturer's specified maximum frontal area for towing. Trailers over 24,000 pounds must have a frontal area between 60 and 75 ft 2 . ( B ) You may ask us to approve the use of a trailer not meeting SAE J2807 specifications. This may apply, for example, if the trailer has tires that are different than but equivalent to the specified tires. In your request, describe the alternative trailer's specifications, why you are using it, and how it is more representative of in-use operation than a trailer meeting the specifications in paragraph (h)(4)(iv)(A) of this section. Rather than demonstrating representativeness, you may instead describe why it is infeasible to use a trailer meeting the specifications in paragraph (h)(4)(iv)(A) of this section. We will consider whether your request is consistent with good engineering judgment. ( 5 ) The accuracy margins in 40 CFR 1036.420(a) do not apply for vehicles with spark-ignition engines, or for vehicles with compression-ignition engines for demonstrating compliance with standards based on measurement procedures with 3-bin moving average windows. ( 6 ) Determine a reference CO 2 emission rate, e CO2FTPFCL, as described in 40 CFR 1036.635(a)(1) or based on measured values from any chassis FTP driving cycles under 40 CFR part 1066, subpart I , that is used for reporting data from an emission data vehicle or a fuel economy data vehicle, as follows: Equation 1 to Paragraph (h)(6) Where: m CO2FTP = CO 2 emission mass in grams emitted over the FTP driving cycle. d FTP = measured driving distance in miles. W FTP = work performed over the FTP. i = an indexing variable that represents a 1 Hz OBD time counter over the course of the FTP drive. N = total number of measurements over the FTP duty cycle = 1874. f n = engine speed for each point, i, starting from the start of the FTP drive at i = 1, collected from OBD PID $0C. T = engine torque in N\u00b7m for each point, i, starting from i = 1. Calculate T by subtracting Friction Torque (PID $8E) from Indicated Torque (PID $62) (both PIDs are percentages) and then multiplying by the reference torque (PID $63). Set torque to zero if friction torque is greater than indicated torque. \u0394 t = 1/ f record f record = the data recording frequency. Example: m CO2FTP = 10,961 g N = 1874 f 1 = 687.3 r/min = 71.97 rad/s f 2 = 689.7 r/min = 72.23 rad/s T 1 = 37.1 ft\u00b7lbf = 50.3 N\u00b7m T 2 = 37.2 ft\u00b7lbf = 50.4 N\u00b7m f record = 1 Hz \u0394 t = 1/1 = 1 s = 0.000277 hr W FTP = 71.97 \u00b7 50.3 \u00b7 1.0 + 72.23 \u00b7 50.4 \u00b7 1.0 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u0192 n1874 \u00b7 T 1874 \u00b7 \u0394 t 1874 W FTP = 53,958,852 W\u00b7s = 20.1 hp\u00b7hr e CO2FTPFCL = 545.3 g/hp\u00b7hr ( 7 ) For testing based on the 3-bin moving average windows, identify the appropriate bin for each of the 300 second test intervals based on its normalized CO 2 emission mass, m CO2,norm,testinterval, instead of the bin definitions in 40 CFR 1036.530(f) , as follows: Table 3 to paragraph ( h )(7) of \u00a7 86.1845-04 \u2014Criteria for Off-Cycle Bins for 3-Bin Moving Average Windows Bin Normalized CO 2 emission mass over the 300 second test interval Bin 1 m CO2,norm,testinterval \u2264 6.00% Bin 2a 6.00% < m CO2,norm,testinterval \u2264 20.00% Bin 2b m CO2,norm,testinterval > 20.00% ( 8 ) For testing based on 3-bin moving average windows, calculate the off-cycle emissions quantity for Bin 2a and Bin 2b using the method described in 40 CFR 1036.530 for Bin 2. Each bin is valid for evaluating test results only if it has at least 2,400 windows. [ 89 FR 28183 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1846-01 Manufacturer in-use confirmatory testing requirements. ( a ) General requirements. ( 1 ) Manufacturers must test, or cause testing to be conducted, under this section when the emission levels shown by a test group sample from testing under \u00a7 86.1845 exceeds the criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The testing required under this section applies separately to each test group and at each test point (low and high mileage) that meets the specified criteria. The testing requirements apply separately for each model year. These provisions do not apply to emissions of CH 4 or N 2 O. ( 2 ) The provisions of \u00a7 86.1845-04(a)(3) regarding fuel sulfur effects apply equally to testing under this section. ( b ) Criteria for additional testing. ( 1 ) A manufacturer shall test a test group, or a subset of a test group, as described in paragraph (j) of this section when the results from testing conducted under \u00a7 86.1845 show mean exhaust emissions of any criteria pollutant for that test group to be at or above 1.30 times the applicable in-use standard for at least 50 percent of vehicles tested from the test group. However, under an interim alternative approach for PM emissions, additional testing is required if 80 percent of vehicles from the test group exceed 1.30 times the in-use standard through model year 2030 for light-duty program vehicles and through 2031 for medium-duty vehicles. ( 2 ) A manufacturer shall test a test group, or a subset of a test group, as described in paragraph (j) of this section when the results from testing conducted under \u00a7 86.1845 show mean exhaust emissions of CO 2 (City-highway combined CREE) for that test group to be at or above the applicable in-use standard for at least 50 percent of vehicles tested from the test group. ( 3 ) Additional testing is not required under this paragraph (b) based on evaporative/refueling testing or based on low-mileage US06 testing conducted under \u00a7 86.1845-04(b)(5)(i) . Testing conducted at high altitude under the requirements of \u00a7 86.1845-04(c) will be included in determining if a test group meets the criteria triggering the testing required under this section. ( 4 ) The vehicle designated for testing under the requirements of \u00a7 86.1845-04(c)(2) with a minimum odometer reading of 105,000 miles or 75% of useful life, whichever is less, will not be included in determining if a test group meets the triggering criteria. ( 5 ) The SFTP composite emission levels for Tier 3 vehicles shall include the IUVP FTP emissions, the IUVP US06 emissions, and the values from the SC03 Air Conditioning EDV certification test (without DFs applied). The calculations shall be made using the equations prescribed in \u00a7 86.164 . If more than one set of certification SC03 data exists (due to running change testing or other reasons), the manufacturer shall choose the SC03 result to use in the calculation from among those data sets using good engineering judgment. ( 6 ) If fewer than 50 percent of the vehicles from a leak family pass either the leak test or the diurnal test under \u00a7 86.1845 , EPA may require further leak testing under this paragraph (b)(6) . Testing under this section must include five vehicles from the family. If all five of these vehicles fail the test, the manufacturer must test five additional vehicles. EPA will determine whether to require further leak testing under this section after providing the manufacturer an opportunity to discuss the results, including consideration of any of the following information, or other items that may be relevant: ( i ) Detailed system design, calibration, and operating information, technical explanations as to why the individual vehicles tested failed the leak standard. ( ii ) Comparison of the subject vehicles to other similar models from the same manufacturer. ( iii ) Data or other information on owner complaints, technical service bulletins, service campaigns, special policy warranty programs, warranty repair data, state I/M data, and data available from other manufacturer-specific programs or initiatives. ( iv ) Evaporative emission test data on any individual vehicles that did not pass leak testing during IUVP. ( c ) Useful life. Vehicles tested under the provisions of this section must be within the useful life specified for the emission standards which were exceeded in the testing under \u00a7 86.1845 . Testing should be within the useful life specified, subject to sections 207(c)(5) and (c)(6) of the Clean Air Act where applicable. ( d ) Number of test vehicles. A manufacturer must test a minimum of ten vehicles of the test group or Agency-designated subset. A manufacturer may, at the manufacturer's discretion, test more than ten vehicles under this paragraph for a specific test group or Agency-designated subset. If a manufacturer chooses to test more than the required ten vehicles, all testing must be completed within the time designated in the testing completion requirements of paragraph (g) of this section. Any vehicles which are eliminated from the sample either prior to or subsequent to testing, or any vehicles for which test results are determined to be void, must be replaced in order that the final sample of vehicles for which test results acceptable to the Agency are available equals a minimum of ten vehicles. A manufacturer may cease testing with a sample of five vehicles if the results of the first five vehicles tested show mean emissions for each pollutant to be less than 75.0 percent of the applicable standard, with no vehicles exceeding the applicable standard for any pollutant. ( e ) Emission testing. Each test vehicle of a test group or Agency-designated subset shall be tested in accordance with the driving cycles performed under \u00a7 86.1845 corresponding to emission levels requiring testing under this section) as described in subpart B of this part , when such test vehicle is tested for compliance with applicable exhaust emission standards under this subpart. ( f ) Geographical limitations. ( 1 ) Test groups or Agency-designated subsets certified to 50-state standards: For low altitude testing no more than 50 percent of the test vehicles may be procured from California. The test vehicles procured from the 49 state area must be procured from a location with a heating degree day 30 year annual average equal to or greater than 4000. ( 2 ) Test groups or Agency-designated subsets certified to 49 state standards: For low-altitude testing all vehicles shall be procured from a location with a heating degree day 30 year annual average equal to or greater than 4000. ( 3 ) Vehicles procured for high altitude testing may be procured from any area provided that the vehicle's primary area of operation was above 4000 feet. ( g ) Testing. Testing required under this section must commence within three months of completion of the testing under \u00a7 86.1845 which triggered the confirmatory testing and must be completed within seven months of the completion of the testing which triggered the confirmatory testing. Any industry review of the results obtained under \u00a7 86.1845 and any additional vehicle procurement and/or testing which takes place under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1845 which the industry believes may affect the triggering of required confirmatory testing must take place within the three month period. The data and the manufacturers reasoning for reconsideration of the data must be provided to the Agency within the three month period. ( h ) Limit on manufacturer conducted testing. For each manufacturer, the maximum number of test group(s) (or Agency-designated subset(s)) of each model year for which testing under this section shall be required is limited to 50 percent of the total number of test groups of each model year required to be tested by each manufacturer as prescribed in \u00a7 86.1845 , rounded to the next highest whole number where appropriate. For each manufacturer with only one test group under \u00a7 86.1845 , such manufacturer shall have a maximum potential testing requirement under this section of one test group (or Agency-designated subset) per model year.

Such tests shall be nondestructive, but may require appropriate mileage (or service) accumulation. A manufacturer may be compelled to cause the personal appearance of any employee at such a facility before an EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA authorized representative by written request for his appearance, signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation or the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, served on the manufacturer. Any such employee who has been instructed by the manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel. \u00a7 86.1850-01 Denial, suspension or revocation of certificate of conformity. ( a ) If, after review of the manufacturer's application, request for certification, information obtained from any inspection, such other information as the Administrator may require, and any other pertinent data or information, the Administrator determines that one or more test vehicles do not meet applicable requirements or standards of the Act or of this part, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer in writing, setting forth the basis for the determination. The manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's determination. ( b ) Notwithstanding the fact that the vehicles described in the application may comply with all other requirements of this subpart, the Administrator may deny issuance of, suspend, or revoke a previously issued certificate of conformity if the Administrator finds any one of the following infractions to be substantial: ( 1 ) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information. ( 2 ) The manufacturer denies an EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative the opportunity to conduct authorized inspections as required under \u00a7 86.1849-01 .

( 5 ) The manufacturer fails to provide the records required in \u00a7 86.1844-01 to the Administrator within the deadline set forth in the request for such information. ( 6 ) The manufacturer fails to comply with all conditions under which the certificate of conformity was granted as specified in 86.1848-01. ( 7 ) The manufacturer otherwise circumvents the intent of the Act or of this part. ( c ) The manufacturer shall bear the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the conditions upon which the certificate was issued were satisfied, or that any failure to satisfy a condition is not substantial. ( d ) If a manufacturer knowingly commits an infraction specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(7) of this section, knowingly commits any fraudulent act which results in the issuance of a certificate of conformity, or fails to comply with the conditions specified in \u00a7 86.1843-01 , the Administrator may deem such certificate void ab initio. ( e ) When the Administrator denies, suspends, revokes, or voids ab initio a certificate, EPA will provide the manufacturer a written determination. The manufacturer may request a hearing under \u00a7 86.1853-01 on the Administrator's decision. ( f ) Any suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity shall extend no further than to forbid the introduction into commerce of vehicles previously covered by the certificate which are still in the possession of the manufacturer, except in cases of such fraud or other misconduct that makes the certification void ab initio. \u00a7 86.1851-01 Application of good engineering judgment to manufacturers' decisions.

( d ) If the Administrator rejects a decision by a manufacturer with respect to the exercise of good engineering judgment, the following provisions shall apply: ( 1 ) If the Administrator determines that incorrect information was deliberately used in the decision process, that important information was deliberately overlooked, that the decision was not made in good faith, or that the decision was not made with a rational basis, the Administrator may suspend or void ab initio a certificate of conformity. ( 2 ) If the Administrator determines that the manufacturer's decision does not meet the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, but that a different decision would reflect a better exercise of good engineering judgment, then the Administrator will notify the manufacturer of this concern and the basis thereof. ( i ) The manufacturer shall have at least 30 days to respond to this notice. The Administrator may extend this response period upon request from the manufacturer if it is necessary to generate additional data for the manufacturer's response. ( ii ) The Administrator shall make the final ruling after considering the information provided by the manufacturer during the response period. If the Administrator determines that the manufacturer's decision was not made using good engineering judgment, he/she may reject that decision and apply the new ruling to future corresponding decisions as soon as practicable. ( e ) The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer in writing regarding any decision reached under paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section. The Administrator shall include in this notification the basis for reaching the determination. ( f ) Within 30 working days following receipt of notification of the Administrator's determinations made under paragraph (d) of this section, the manufacturer may request a hearing on those determinations. The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized representative of the manufacturer, and shall include a statement specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determinations, and data or other analysis in support of such objections.

( a ) The Administrator may waive requirements of this subpart relating to development of emission-related information or test data if the Administrator determines with confidence that the in-use emission test verification data required in \u00a7 86.1845-01 are below the applicable emission standards for an appropriate period of time, and that such performance is likely to continue in subsequent model years. ( b ) Any waiver granted under paragraph (a) of this section will be granted only if the Administrator determines that the waived requirement is not needed to assure continued emission compliance and the Administrator will have sufficient testing and other information in order to make certification decisions. ( c ) Any waiver granted under paragraph (a) of this section would be limited in duration to a period of one model year, unless extended by the Administrator as a result of continued demonstrations of good in-use emission performance. ( d ) The Administrator reserves the right to deny or revoke a waiver which may have been granted if he/she determines that the manufacturer no longer qualifies for the waiver. \u00a7 86.1853-01 Certification hearings. If a manufacturer's request for a hearing is approved, EPA will follow the hearing procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1068, subpart G .

( iii ) Except as provided in Section 207(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7541(c)(3) ), to provide directly or indirectly in any communication to the ultimate purchaser or any subsequent purchaser that the coverage of a warranty under the Clean Air Act is conditioned upon use of any part, component, or system manufactured by the manufacturer or a person acting for the manufacturer or under its control, or conditioned upon service performed by such persons. ( iv ) To fail or refuse to comply with the terms and conditions of the warranty under Section 207(a) or (b) of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7541(a) or (b) ). ( b ) For the purposes of enforcement of this subpart, the following apply: ( 1 ) No action with respect to any element of design referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section (including any adjustment or alteration of such element) shall be treated as a prohibited act under paragraph (a)(3) of this section if such action is in accordance with Section 215 of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7549 ); ( 2 ) Nothing in paragraph (a)(3) of this section is to be construed to require the use of manufacturer parts in maintaining or repairing a vehicle or engine. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the term \u201cmanufacturer parts\u201d means, with respect to a motor vehicle engine, parts produced or sold by the manufacturer of the motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine; ( 3 ) Actions for the purpose of repair or replacement of a device or element of design or any other item are not considered prohibited acts under paragraph (a)(3) of this section if the action is a necessary and temporary procedure, the device or element is replaced upon completion of the procedure, and the action results in the proper functioning of the device or element of design; ( 4 ) Actions for the purpose of a conversion of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine for use of a clean alternative fuel (as defined in title II of the Clean Air Act) are not considered prohibited acts under paragraph (a) of this section if: ( i ) The vehicle complies with the applicable standard when operating on the alternative fuel; and ( ii ) In the case of engines converted to dual fuel or flexible use, the device or element is replaced upon completion of the conversion procedure, and the action results in proper functioning of the device or element when the motor vehicle operates on conventional fuel. [ 75 FR 25691 , May 7, 2010] \u00a7\u00a7 86.1855-86.1859 [Reserved] 86.1860-17 How to comply with the Tier 3 and Tier 4 fleet average standards. ( a ) You must show that you meet the applicable Tier 3 fleet average NMOG+NO X standards from \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811-17 and 86.1816-18 , the Tier 3 fleet average evaporative emission standards from \u00a7 86.1813-17 , and the Tier 4 fleet average NMOG+NO X standards from \u00a7 86.1811-27 as described in this section. Note that separate fleet average calculations are required for Tier 3 FTP and SFTP exhaust emission standards under \u00a7 86.1811-17 . ( b ) Calculate your fleet average value for each model year for all vehicle models subject to a separate fleet average standard using the following equation, rounded to the nearest 0.001 g/mile for NMOG+NO X emissions and the nearest 0.001 g/test for evaporative emissions: Equation 1 to Paragraph (b) Where: i = A counter associated with each separate test group or evaporative family. b = The number of separate test groups or evaporative families from a given averaging set to which you certify your vehicles. N i = The actual nationwide sales for the model year for test group or evaporative family i. Include allowances for evaporative emissions as described in \u00a7 86.1813 . FEL i = The FEL selected for test group or evaporative family i. Disregard any separate standards that apply for in-use testing or for testing under high-altitude conditions. N total = The actual nationwide sales for the model year for all vehicles from the averaging set, except as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The pool of vehicle models included in N total may vary by model year, and it may be different for evaporative standards, FTP exhaust standards, and SFTP exhaust standards in a given model year. ( c ) Do not include any of the following vehicles to calculate your fleet-average value: ( 1 ) Vehicles that you do not certify to the standards of this part because they are permanently exempted under 40 CFR part 85 or part 1068. ( 2 ) Exported vehicles. ( 3 ) Vehicles excluded under \u00a7 86.1801 . ( d ) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, your calculated fleet-average value may not exceed the corresponding fleet-average standard for the model year. ( e ) You may generate or use emission credits related to your calculated fleet-average value as follows: ( 1 ) You may generate emission credits as described in \u00a7 86.1861 if your fleet-average value is below the corresponding fleet-average standard. ( 2 ) You may use emission credits as described in \u00a7 86.1861 if your fleet-average value is above the corresponding fleet-average standard. Except as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, you must use enough credits for each model year to show that your adjusted fleet average value does not exceed the fleet-average standard. ( 3 ) The following provisions apply if you do not have enough emission credits to demonstrate compliance with a fleet-average standard in a given model year: ( i ) You may have a credit deficit for up to three model years within an averaging set under \u00a7 86.1861-17(c) . You may not bank emission credits with respect to a given emission standard during a model year in which you have a credit deficit in the same averaging set. If you fail to meet the fleet-average standard for four consecutive model years, the vehicles causing you to exceed the fleet-average standard will be considered not covered by the certificate of conformity. You will be subject to penalties on an individual-vehicle basis for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate of conformity. ( ii ) You must notify us in writing how you plan to eliminate the credit deficit within the specified time frame. If we determine that your plan is unreasonable or unrealistic, we may deny an application for certification for a test group or evaporative family if its bin standard or FEL would increase your credit deficit. We may determine that your plan is unreasonable or unrealistic based on a consideration of past and projected use of specific technologies, the historical sales mix of your vehicle models, your commitment to limit sales of higher-emission vehicles, and expected access to traded credits. We may also consider your plan unreasonable if your fleet-average emission level increases relative to the first model year of a credit deficit or any later model year. We may require that you send us interim reports describing your progress toward resolving your credit deficit over the course of a model year. ( f ) If the applicable bin standards and FELs for all your vehicle models are at or below a corresponding fleet-average standard for a given model year, and you do not want to generate emission credits, you may omit the calculations described in this section. ( g ) For purposes of calculating the statute of limitations, the following actions are all considered to occur at the expiration of the deadline for offsetting a deficit as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section: ( 1 ) Failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section. ( 2 ) Failing to satisfy the conditions upon which a certificate was issued relative to offsetting a deficit. ( 3 ) Selling, offering for sale, introducing or delivering into U.S. commerce, or importing vehicles that are found not to be covered by a certificate as a result of failing to offset a deficit. [ 79 FR 23735 , Apr. 28, 2014, as amended at 89 FR 28190 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1861-17 How do the NMOG + NO X and evaporative emission credit programs work? You may use emission credits for purposes of certification to show compliance with the applicable fleet average NMOG+NO X standards from \u00a7\u00a7 86.1811 and 86.1816 and the fleet average evaporative emission standards from \u00a7 86.1813 as described in 40 CFR part 1037, subpart H , with certain exceptions and clarifications as specified in this section. MDPVs are subject to the same provisions of this section that apply to LDT4. ( a ) Calculate emission credits as described in this paragraph (a) instead of using the provisions of 40 CFR 1037.705 . Calculate positive or negative emission credits relative to the applicable fleet average standard. Calculate positive emission credits if your fleet average level is below the standard. Calculate negative emission credits if your fleet average value is above the standard. Calculate credits separately for each applicable fleet average standard and calculate total credits for each averaging set as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Convert units from mg/mile to g/mile as needed for performing calculations. Calculate emission credits using the following equation, rounded to the nearest whole number: Equation 1 to Paragraph (a) Emission credit = Volume \u00b7 [ Fleet average standard\u2212Fleet average value ] Where: Emission credit = The positive or negative credit for each discrete fleet average standard, in units of vehicle-grams per mile for NMOG+NOx and vehicle-grams per test for evaporative emissions. Volume = Sales volume in a given model year from the collection of test groups or evaporative families covered by the fleet average value, as described in \u00a7 86.1860 . ( b ) The following restrictions apply instead of those specified in 40 CFR 1037.740 : ( 1 ) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, emission credits may be exchanged only within an averaging set, as follows: ( i ) HDV represent a separate averaging set with respect to all emission standards. ( ii ) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, light-duty program vehicles represent a single averaging set with respect to all emission standards. Note that FTP and SFTP credits for Tier 3 vehicles are not interchangeable. ( iii ) LDV and LDT1 certified to standards based on a useful life of 120,000 miles and 10 years together represent a single averaging set with respect to NMOG+NO X emission standards. Note that FTP and SFTP credits for Tier 3 vehicles are not interchangeable. ( iv ) The following separate averaging sets apply for evaporative emission standards: ( A ) LDV and LDT1 together represent a single averaging set. ( B ) LDT2 represents a single averaging set. ( C ) HLDT represents a single averaging set. ( D ) HDV represents a single averaging set. ( 2 ) You may exchange evaporative emission credits across averaging sets as follows if you need additional credits to offset a deficit after the final year of maintaining deficit credits as allowed under paragraph (c) of this section: ( i ) You may exchange LDV/LDT1 and LDT2 emission credits. ( ii ) You may exchange HLDT and HDV emission credits. ( 3 ) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, credits expire after five years. For example, credits you generate in model year 2018 may be used only through model year 2023. ( 4 ) For the Tier 3 declining fleet average FTP and SFTP emission standards for NMOG+NO X described in \u00a7 86.1811-17(b)(8) , credits generated in model years 2017 through 2024 expire after eight years, or after model year 2030, whichever comes first; however, these credits may not be traded after five years. This extended credit life also applies for small-volume manufacturers generating credits under \u00a7 86.1811-17(h)(1) in model years 2022 through 2024. Note that the longer credit life does not apply for heavy-duty vehicles, for vehicles certified under the alternate phase-in described in \u00a7 86.1811-17(b)(9) , or for vehicles generating early Tier 3 credits under \u00a7 86.1811-17(b)(11) in model year 2017. ( 5 ) Tier 3 credits for NMOG+NO X may be used to demonstrate compliance with Tier 4 standards without adjustment, except as specified in \u00a7 86.1811-27(b)(6)(ii) . ( 6 ) A manufacturer may generate NMOG+NO X credits from model year 2027 through 2032 electric vehicles that qualify as MDPV and use those credits for certifying medium-duty vehicles, as follows: ( i ) Calculate generated credits separately for qualifying vehicles. Calculate generated credits by multiplying the applicable standard for light-duty program vehicles by the sales volume of qualifying vehicles in a given model year. ( ii ) Apply generated credits to eliminate any deficit for light-duty program vehicles before using them to certify medium-duty vehicles. ( iii ) Apply the credit provisions of this section as specified, except that you may not buy or sell credits generated under this paragraph (b)(6) . ( iv ) Describe in annual credit reports how you are generating certain credit quantities under this paragraph (b)(6) . Also describe in your end of year credit report how you will use those credits for certifying light-duty program vehicles or medium-duty vehicles in a given model year. ( c ) The credit-deficit provisions 40 CFR 1037.745 apply to the NMOG+NO X and evaporative emission standards for Tier 3 and Tier 4 vehicles. Credit-deficit provisions are not affected by the transition from Tier 3 to Tier 4 standards. ( d ) The reporting and recordkeeping provisions of \u00a7 86.1862 apply instead of those specified in 40 CFR 1037.730 and 1037.735 . ( e ) The provisions of 40 CFR 1037.645 do not apply. ( f ) The enforcement provisions described in \u00a7 86.1865-12(j)(3) apply with respect to NMOG+NO X emission credits under this section for battery electric vehicles that do not conform to battery durability requirements in \u00a7 86.1815-27 . [ 89 FR 28190 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1862-04 Maintenance of records and submittal of information relevant to compliance with fleet average standards. ( a ) Overview. This section describes reporting and recordkeeping requirements for vehicles subject to the following standards: ( 1 ) Tier 4 criteria exhaust emission standards, including cold temperature NMOG+NO X standards, in \u00a7 86.1811-27 . ( 2 ) Tier 3 evaporative emission standards in \u00a7 86.1813-17 . ( 3 ) Tier 3 FTP emission standard for NMOG+NO X for LDV and LDT in \u00a7 86.1811-17 . ( 4 ) Tier 3 SFTP emission standard for NMOG+NO X for LDV and LDT (including MDPV) in \u00a7 86.1811-17 . ( 5 ) Tier 3 FTP emission standard for NMOG+NO X for HDV (other than MDPV) in \u00a7 86.1816-18 . ( 6 ) Cold temperature NMHC standards in \u00a7 86.1811-17 for vehicles subject to Tier 3 NMOG+NO X standards. ( b ) Maintenance of records. ( 1 ) The manufacturer producing any vehicles subject to a fleet-average standard under this subpart must establish and maintain all the following information in organized and indexed records for each model year: ( i ) Model year. ( ii ) Applicable fleet-average standard. ( iii ) Calculated fleet-average value. ( iv ) All values used in calculating the fleet-average value achieved. ( 2 ) The manufacturer producing any vehicle subject to the provisions in this section must keep all the following information for each vehicle: ( i ) Model year. ( ii ) Applicable fleet-average standard. ( iii ) EPA test group or evaporative family, as applicable. ( iv ) Assembly plant. ( v ) Vehicle identification number. ( vi ) The FEL and the fleet-average standard to which the vehicle is certified. ( vii ) Information on the point of first sale, including the purchaser, city, and state. ( 3 ) The manufacturer must retain all records required to be maintained under this section for a period of eight years from the due date for the annual report. Records may be stored in any format and on any media, as long as manufacturers can promptly send EPA organized written records in English if we ask for them. Manufacturers must keep records readily available as EPA may review them at any time. ( 4 ) The Administrator may require the manufacturer to retain additional records or submit information not specifically required by this section. ( 5 ) EPA may void ab initio a certificate of conformity for a vehicle certified to emission standards as set forth or otherwise referenced in this subpart for which the manufacturer fails to retain the records required in this section, to provide such information to the Administrator upon request, or to submit the reports required in this section in the specified time period. ( c ) Reporting. ( 1 ) Each manufacturer must submit an annual report. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the annual report must contain, for each applicable fleet average standard, the fleet average value achieved, all values required to calculate the fleet-average value, the number of credits generated or debits incurred, all the values required to calculate the credits or debits, and sufficient information to show compliance with all phase-in requirements, if applicable. The annual report must also contain the resulting balance of credits or debits. ( 2 ) When a manufacturer calculates compliance with the fleet average standard using the provisions in \u00a7 86.1860-17(f) , the annual report must state that the manufacturer has elected to use such provision and must contain the fleet average standard as the fleet average value for that model year. ( 3 ) For each applicable fleet-average standard, the annual report must also include documentation on all credit transactions the manufacturer has engaged in since those included in the last report. Information for each transaction must include all the following information: ( i ) Name of credit provider. ( ii ) Name of credit recipient. ( iii ) Date the transfer occurred. ( iv ) Quantity of credits transferred. ( v ) Model year in which the credits were earned. ( 4 ) Unless a manufacturer reports the data required by this section in the annual production report required under \u00a7 86.1844-01(e) and subsequent model year provisions, a manufacturer must submit an annual report for each model year after production ends for all affected vehicles produced by the manufacturer subject to the provisions of this subpart and no later than May 1 of the calendar year following the given model year. Annual reports must be submitted to: Director, Compliance Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2000 Traverwood, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105. ( 5 ) Failure by a manufacturer to submit the annual report in the specified time period for all vehicles subject to the provisions in this section is a violation of Clean Air Act section 203(a)(1) ( 42 U.S.C 7522(a)(1) ) for each subject vehicle produced by that manufacturer. ( 6 ) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error occurred on an annual report previously submitted to EPA, the manufacturer's credit or debit calculations will be recalculated. EPA may void erroneous credits, unless transferred, and must adjust erroneous debits. In the case of transferred erroneous credits, EPA must adjust the selling manufacturer's credit or debit balance to reflect the sale of such credits and any resulting generation of debits. ( d ) Notice of opportunity for hearing. Any voiding of the certificate under this section will be made only after EPA has offered the manufacturer concerned an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with 40 CFR part 1068, subpart G , and, if a manufacturer requests such a hearing, will be made only after an initial decision by the Presiding Officer. [ 79 FR 23735 , Apr. 28, 2014, as amended at 81 FR 73992 , Oct. 25, 2016; 89 FR 28191 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1864-10 How to comply with cold temperature fleet average standards. ( a ) Applicability. Cold temperature fleet average standards apply for NMHC or NMOG+NO X emissions as described in \u00a7 86.1811 . Certification testing provisions described in this subpart apply equally for meeting cold temperature exhaust emission standards except as specified. ( b ) Calculating the cold temperature fleet average standard. Manufacturers must compute separate sales-weighted cold temperature fleet average emissions at the end of the model year using actual sales and certifying test groups to FELs, as defined in \u00a7 86.1803-01 . The FEL becomes the standard for each test group, and every test group can have a different FEL. The certification resolution for the FEL is 0.1 grams/mile for NMHC and 0.010 grams/mile for NMOG+NO X . Determine fleet average emissions separately for each set of vehicles subject to different fleet average emission standards. Do not include electric vehicles or fuel cell vehicles when calculating fleet average emissions. Starting with Tier 4 vehicles, determine fleet average emissions based on separate averaging sets for light-duty program vehicles and medium-duty vehicles. Convert units between mg/mile and g/mile as needed for performing calculations. Calculate the sales-weighted cold temperature fleet averages using the following equation, rounded to the nearest 0.1 grams/mile for NMHC and to the nearest 0.001 grams/mile for NMOG+NO X : Equation 1 to Paragraph (b) Where: N = The number of vehicles subject to a given fleet average emission standard based on vehicles counted at the point of first sale. FEL = Family Emission Limit (grams/mile). Volume = Total number of vehicles sold from the applicable cold temperature averaging set. ( c ) Certification compliance and enforcement requirements for cold temperature fleet average standards. Each manufacturer must comply on an annual basis with fleet average standards as follows: ( 1 ) Manufacturers must report in their annual reports to the Agency that they met the relevant fleet average standard by showing that their sales-weighted cold temperature fleet average emissions are at or below the applicable fleet average standard for each averaging set. ( 2 ) If the sales-weighted average is above the applicable fleet average standard, manufacturers must obtain and apply sufficient credits as permitted under paragraph (d)(8) of this section. A manufacturer must show via the use of credits that they have offset any exceedance of the cold temperature fleet average standard. Manufacturers must also include their credit balances or deficits. ( 3 ) If a manufacturer fails to meet the cold temperature fleet average standard for two consecutive years, the vehicles causing the exceedance will be considered not covered by the certificate of conformity (see paragraph (d)(8) of this section). A manufacturer will be subject to penalties on an individual-vehicle basis for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate. ( 4 ) EPA will review each manufacturer's sales to designate the vehicles that caused the exceedance of the fleet average standard. EPA will designate as nonconforming those vehicles in test groups with the highest certification emission values first, continuing until reaching a number of vehicles equal to the calculated number of noncomplying vehicles as determined above. In a group where only a portion of vehicles would be deemed nonconforming, EPA will determine the actual nonconforming vehicles by counting backwards from the last vehicle produced in that test group. Manufacturers will be liable for penalties for each vehicle sold that is not covered by a certificate. ( d ) Requirements for the cold temperature averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program. ( 1 ) Manufacturers must average the cold temperature fleet average emissions of their vehicles and comply with the cold temperature fleet average standard. A manufacturer whose cold temperature fleet average emissions exceed the applicable standard must complete the calculation in paragraph (d)(4) of this section to determine the size of its credit deficit. A manufacturer whose cold temperature fleet average emissions are less than the applicable standard must complete the calculation in paragraph (d)(4) of this section to generate credits. ( 2 ) There are no property rights associated with cold temperature credits generated under this subpart. Credits are a limited authorization to emit the designated amount of emissions. Nothing in this part or any other provision of law should be construed to limit EPA's authority to terminate or limit this authorization through rulemaking. ( 3 ) The following transition provisions apply: ( i ) Cold temperature NMHC credits may be used to demonstrate compliance with the cold temperature NMOG+NO X emission standards for Tier 4 vehicles. The value of a cold temperature NMHC credit is deemed to be equal to the value of a cold temperature NMOG+NO X credit. ( ii ) Credits earned from any light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles may be used for any light-duty program vehicles, even if they were originally generated for a narrower averaging set. ( 4 ) Credits are earned on the last day of the model year. Manufacturers must calculate, for a given model year, the number of credits or debits it has generated according to the following equation, rounded to the nearest 0.1 vehicle-grams/mile: Equation 2 to Paragraph (d)(4) Fleet average Credits or Debits = ( Standard \u2212 Emissions ) \u00d7 Volume Where: Standard = the cold temperature NMHC or NMOG+NO X standard. Emissions = the manufacturer's sales-weighted cold temperature fleet average emissions, calculated according to paragraph (b) of this section. Volume = total number of 50-state vehicles sold, based on the point of first sale. ( 5 ) NMHC and NMOG+NO X credits are not subject to any discount or expiration date except as required under the deficit carryforward provisions of paragraph (d)(8) of this section. There is no discounting of unused credits. NMHC and NMOG+NO X credits have unlimited lives, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. ( 6 ) Credits may be used as follows: ( i ) Credits generated and calculated according to the method in paragraph (d)(4) of this section may be used only to offset deficits accrued with respect to the standard in \u00a7 86.1811-10(g)(2) . Credits may be banked and used in a future model year in which a manufacturer's average cold temperature fleet average level exceeds the applicable standard. Credits may be exchanged only within averaging sets. Credits may also be traded to another manufacturer according to the provisions in paragraph (d)(9) of this section. Before trading or carrying over credits to the next model year, a manufacturer must apply available credits to offset any credit deficit, where the deadline to offset that credit deficit has not yet passed. ( ii ) The use of credits shall not be permitted to address Selective Enforcement Auditing or in-use testing failures. The enforcement of the averaging standard occurs through the vehicle's certificate of conformity. A manufacturer's certificate of conformity is conditioned upon compliance with the averaging provisions. The certificate will be void ab initio if a manufacturer fails to meet the corporate average standard and does not obtain appropriate credits to cover its shortfalls in that model year or in the subsequent model year (see deficit carryforward provision in paragraph (d)(8) of this section). Manufacturers must track their certification levels and sales unless they produce only vehicles certified with FELs at or below the applicable to cold temperature fleet average levels below the standard and have chosen to forgo credit banking. ( 7 ) The following provisions apply if debits are accrued: ( i ) If a manufacturer calculates that it has negative credits (also called \u201cdebits\u201d or a \u201ccredit deficit\u201d) for a given model year, it may carry that deficit forward into the next model year. Such a carry-forward may only occur after the manufacturer exhausts any supply of banked credits. At the end of that next model year, the deficit must be covered with an appropriate number of credits that the manufacturer generates or purchases. Any remaining deficit is subject to an enforcement action, as described in this paragraph (d)(8) . Manufacturers are not permitted to have a credit deficit for two consecutive years. ( ii ) If debits are not offset within the specified time period, the number of vehicles not meeting the cold temperature fleet average standards (and therefore not covered by the certificate) must be calculated by dividing the total amount of debits for the model year by the cold temperature fleet average standard applicable for the model year in which the debits were first incurred. ( iii ) EPA will determine the number of vehicles for which the condition on the certificate was not satisfied by designating vehicles in those test groups with the highest certification cold temperature NMHC or NMOG+NO X emission values first and continuing until reaching a number of vehicles equal to the calculated number of noncomplying vehicles as determined above. If this calculation determines that only a portion of vehicles in a test group contribute to the debit, EPA will designate actual vehicles in that test group as not covered by the certificate, starting with the last vehicle produced and counting backwards. ( iv ) ( A ) If a manufacturer ceases production of vehicles affected by a debit balance, the manufacturer continues to be responsible for offsetting any debits outstanding within the required time period. Any failure to offset the debits will be considered a violation of paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section and may subject the manufacturer to an enforcement action for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate, pursuant to paragraphs (d)(8)(ii) and (iii) of this section. ( B ) If a manufacturer is purchased by, merges with, or otherwise combines with another manufacturer, the controlling entity is responsible for offsetting any debits outstanding within the required time period. Any failure to offset the debits will be considered a violation of paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section and may subject the manufacturer to an enforcement action for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate, pursuant to paragraphs (d)(8)(ii) and (iii) of this section. ( v ) For purposes of calculating the statute of limitations, a violation of the requirements of paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section, a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which a certificate(s) was issued and hence a sale of vehicles not covered by the certificate, all occur upon the expiration of the deadline for offsetting debits specified in paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section. ( 8 ) The following provisions apply for trading cold temperature credits: ( i ) EPA may reject credit trades if the involved manufacturers fail to submit the credit trade notification in the annual report. A manufacturer may not sell credits that are not available for sale pursuant to the provisions in paragraphs (d)(7)(i) of this section. ( ii ) In the event of a negative credit balance resulting from a transaction that a manufacturer could not cover by the reporting deadline for the model year in which the trade occurred, both the buyer and seller are liable, except in cases involving fraud by either the buyer or seller. EPA may void ab initio the certificates of conformity of all engine families participating in such a trade. ( iii ) A manufacturer may only trade credits that it has generated pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section or acquired from another party.

( 2 ) Heavy-duty vehicles. HDV manufacturers that qualify as small businesses are not subject to the Phase 1 greenhouse gas standards of this subpart as specified in \u00a7 86.1819-14(k)(5) . ( e ) CO 2 fleet average exhaust emission standards. The fleet average standards referred to in this section are the corporate fleet average CO 2 standards for passenger automobiles and light trucks set forth in \u00a7 86.1818-12(c) and (e) , and for HDV in \u00a7 86.1819 . Each manufacturer must comply with the applicable CO 2 fleet average standard on a production-weighted average basis, for each separate averaging set, at the end of each model year, using the procedure described in paragraph (j) of this section. The fleet average CO 2 standards applicable in a given model year are calculated separately for passenger automobiles and light trucks for each manufacturer and each model year according to the provisions in \u00a7 86.1818 . Calculate the HDV fleet average CO 2 standard in a given model year as described in \u00a7 86.1819-14(a) . ( f ) In-use CO 2 standards. In-use CO 2 exhaust emission standards are provided in \u00a7 86.1818-12(d) for passenger automobiles and light trucks and in \u00a7 86.1819-14(b) for HDV. ( g ) Durability procedures and method of determining deterioration factors (DFs). Deterioration factors for CO 2 exhaust emission standards are provided in \u00a7 86.1823-08(m) for passenger automobiles and light trucks and in \u00a7 86.1819-14(d)(5) for HDV. ( h ) Vehicle test procedures. ( 1 ) The test procedures for demonstrating compliance with CO 2 exhaust emission standards are described at \u00a7 86.101 and 40 CFR part 600, subpart B . Note that these test procedures involve measurement of carbon-related exhaust emissions to demonstrate compliance with the fleet average CO 2 standards in \u00a7 86.1818-12 . ( 2 ) Testing to determine compliance with CO 2 exhaust emission standards must be on a loaded vehicle weight (LVW) basis for passenger automobiles and light trucks (including MDPV), and on an adjusted loaded vehicle weight (ALVW) basis for non-MDPV heavy-duty vehicles. ( 3 ) Testing for the purpose of providing certification data is required only at low-altitude conditions. If hardware and software emission control strategies used during low-altitude condition testing are not used similarly across all altitudes for in-use operation, the manufacturer must include a statement in the application for certification, in accordance with \u00a7 86.1844-01(d)(11) , stating what the different strategies are and why they are used. ( i ) Calculating fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions for passenger automobiles and light trucks. ( 1 ) Manufacturers must compute separate production-weighted fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions at the end of the model year for passenger automobiles and light trucks, using actual production, where production means vehicles produced and delivered for sale, and certifying model types to standards as defined in \u00a7 86.1818-12 . The model type carbon-related exhaust emission results determined according to 40 CFR part 600, subpart F (in units of grams per mile rounded to the nearest whole number) become the certification standard for each model type. ( 2 ) Manufacturers must separately calculate production-weighted fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions levels for the following averaging sets according to the provisions of 40 CFR part 600, subpart F : ( i ) Passenger automobiles subject to the fleet average CO 2 standards specified in \u00a7 86.1818-12(c)(2) ; ( ii ) Light trucks subject to the fleet average CO 2 standards specified in \u00a7 86.1818-12(c)(3) ; ( iii ) Passenger automobiles subject to the Temporary Leadtime Allowance Alternative Standards specified in \u00a7 86.1818-12(e) , if applicable; and ( iv ) Light trucks subject to the Temporary Leadtime Allowance Alternative Standards specified in \u00a7 86.1818-12(e) , if applicable. ( j ) Certification compliance and enforcement requirements for CO 2 exhaust emission standards. ( 1 ) Compliance and enforcement requirements are provided in this section and \u00a7 86.1848-10 . ( 2 ) The certificate issued for each test group requires all model types within that test group to meet the in-use emission standards to which each model type is certified. The in-use standards for passenger automobiles and light trucks (including MDPV) are described in \u00a7 86.1818-12(d) . The in-use standards for medium-duty vehicles are described in \u00a7 86.1819-14(b) . ( 3 ) EPA will issue a notice of nonconformity as described in 40 CFR part 85, subpart S , if EPA or the manufacturer determines that a substantial number of a class or category of vehicles produced by that manufacturer, although properly maintained and used, do not conform to in-use CO 2 emission standards, or do not conform to the monitor accuracy and battery durability requirements in \u00a7 86.1815-27 . The manufacturer must submit a remedial plan in response to a notice of nonconformity as described in 40 CFR 85.1803 . The manufacturer's remedial plan would generally be a recall intended to remedy repairable problems to bring nonconforming vehicles into compliance; however, if there is no demonstrable, repairable problem that could be remedied to bring the vehicles into compliance, the manufacturer must submit an alternative plan to address the noncompliance and notify owners. For example, manufacturers may need to calculate a correction to its emission credit balance based on the GHG emissions of the actual number of vehicles produced. Manufacturers may voluntarily recall vehicles to remedy a noncompliance and submit a voluntary recall report as described in 40 CFR part 85, subpart T . Manufacturers may also voluntarily pursue a credit-based or other alternative approach to remedy a noncompliance where appropriate. ( 4 ) Any remedial plan under paragraph (j)(3) of this section, whether voluntary or in response to a notice of nonconformity, must fully correct the difference between the measured in-use CREE of the affected class or category of vehicles and the reported CREE used to calculate the manufacturer's fleet average and credit balances. ( 5 ) The manufacturer may request a hearing under 40 CFR part 1068, subpart G , regarding any voiding of credits or adjustment of debits under paragraph (j)(3) of this section. Manufacturers must submit such a request in writing describing the objection and any supporting data within 30 days after we make a decision. ( 6 ) Each manufacturer must comply with the applicable CO 2 fleet average standard on a production-weighted average basis, at the end of each model year. Use the procedure described in paragraph (i) of this section for passenger automobiles and light trucks (including MDPV). Use the procedure described in \u00a7 86.1819-14(d)(9)(iv) for medium-duty vehicles. ( 7 ) Each manufacturer must comply on an annual basis with the fleet average standards as follows: ( i ) Manufacturers must report in their annual reports to the Agency that they met the relevant corporate average standard by showing that the applicable production-weighted average CO 2 emission levels are at or below the applicable fleet average standards; or ( ii ) If the production-weighted average is above the applicable fleet average standard, manufacturers must obtain and apply sufficient CO 2 credits as authorized under paragraph (k)(8) of this section. A manufacturer must show that they have offset any exceedance of the corporate average standard via the use of credits. Manufacturers must also include their credit balances or deficits in their annual report to the Agency. ( iii ) If a manufacturer fails to meet the corporate average CO 2 standard for four consecutive years, the vehicles causing the corporate average exceedance will be considered not covered by the certificate of conformity (see paragraph (k)(8) of this section). A manufacturer will be subject to penalties on an individual-vehicle basis for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate. ( iv ) EPA will review each manufacturer's production to designate the vehicles that caused the exceedance of the corporate average standard. EPA will designate as nonconforming those vehicles in test groups with the highest certification emission values first, continuing until reaching a number of vehicles equal to the calculated number of noncomplying vehicles as determined in paragraph (k)(8) of this section. In a group where only a portion of vehicles would be deemed nonconforming, EPA will determine the actual nonconforming vehicles by counting backwards from the last vehicle produced in that test group. Manufacturers will be liable for penalties for each vehicle sold that is not covered by a certificate. ( k ) Requirements for the CO 2 averaging, banking and trading (ABT) program. ( 1 ) A manufacturer whose CO 2 fleet average emissions exceed the applicable standard must complete the calculation in paragraph (k)(4) of this section to determine the size of its CO 2 deficit. A manufacturer whose CO 2 fleet average emissions are less than the applicable standard may complete the calculation in paragraph (k)(4) of this section to generate CO 2 credits. In either case, the number of credits or debits must be rounded to the nearest whole number. ( 2 ) There are no property rights associated with CO 2 credits generated under this subpart. Credits are a limited authorization to emit the designated amount of emissions. Nothing in this part or any other provision of law shall be construed to limit EPA's authority to terminate or limit this authorization through a rulemaking. ( 3 ) Each manufacturer must comply with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (l) of this section for CO 2 credits, including early credits. The averaging, banking and trading program is enforceable as provided in paragraphs (k)(7)(ii) , (k)(9)(iii) , and (l)(1)(vi) of this section through the certificate of conformity that allows the manufacturer to introduce any regulated vehicles into U.S. commerce. ( 4 ) Credits are earned on the last day of the model year. Manufacturers must calculate, for a given model year and separately for passenger automobiles, light trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles, the number of credits or debits it has generated according to the following equation rounded to the nearest megagram: CO 2 Credits or Debits (Mg) = [( CO 2 Standard \u2212 Manufacturer's Production-Weighted Fleet Average CO 2 Emissions ) \u00d7 ( Total Number of Vehicles Produced ) \u00d7 ( Mileage )] \u00f7 1,000,000 Where: CO 2 Standard = the applicable standard for the model year as determined in \u00a7 86.1818 or \u00a7 86.1819 ; Manufacturer's Production-Weighted Fleet Average CO 2 Emissions = average calculated according to paragraph (i) of this section; Total Number of Vehicles Produced = the number of vehicles domestically produced plus those imported as defined in \u00a7 600.511-08 of this chapter ; and Mileage = useful life value (in miles) for HDV, and vehicle lifetime miles of 195,264 for passenger automobiles and 225,865 for light trucks. ( 5 ) Determine total HDV debits and credits for a model year as described in \u00a7 86.1819-14(d)(6) . Determine total passenger car and light truck debits and credits for a model year as described in this paragraph (k)(5) . Total credits or debits generated in a model year, maintained and reported separately for passenger automobiles and light trucks, shall be the sum of the credits or debits calculated in paragraph (k)(4) of this section and any of the following credits, if applicable, minus any CO 2 -equivalent debits for N 2 O and/or CH 4 calculated according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1818-12(f)(4) : ( i ) Air conditioning leakage credits earned according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1867-12(b) . ( ii ) Air conditioning efficiency credits earned according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1868-12(c) . ( iii ) Off-cycle technology credits earned according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1869-12(d) . ( iv ) Full size pickup truck credits earned according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1870-12(c) . ( v ) Advanced technology vehicle credits earned according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1866-12(b)(3) . ( vi ) CO 2 -equivalent debits for N 2 O and/or CH 4 accumulated according to the provisions of \u00a7 86.1818-12(f)(4) . ( 6 ) Unused CO 2 credits generally retain their full value through five model years after the model year in which they were generated; credits remaining at the end of the fifth model year after the model year in which they were generated may not be used to demonstrate compliance for later model years. However, in the case of model year 2017 and 2018 passenger cars and light trucks, unused CO 2 credits retain their full value through six model years after the year in which they were generated. ( 7 ) Credits may be used as follows: ( i ) Credits generated and calculated according to the method in paragraphs (k)(4) and (5) of this section may not be used to offset deficits other than those deficits accrued within the respective averaging set, except that credits may be transferred between the passenger automobile and light truck fleets of a given manufacturer. Credits may be banked and used in a future model year in which a manufacturer's average CO 2 level exceeds the applicable standard. Credits may also be traded to another manufacturer according to the provisions in paragraph (k)(8) of this section. Before trading or carrying over credits to the next model year, a manufacturer must apply available credits to offset any deficit, where the deadline to offset that credit deficit has not yet passed. This paragraph (k)(7)(i) applies for MDPV, but not for other HDV. ( ii ) The use of credits shall not change Selective Enforcement Auditing or in-use testing failures from a failure to a non-failure. The enforcement of the averaging standard occurs through the vehicle's certificate of conformity as described in paragraph (k)(8) of this section. A manufacturer's certificate of conformity is conditioned upon compliance with the averaging provisions. The certificate will be void ab initio if a manufacturer fails to meet the corporate average standard and does not obtain appropriate credits to cover its shortfalls in that model year or subsequent model years (see deficit carry-forward provisions in paragraph (k)(8) of this section). ( iii ) [Reserved] ( iv ) Credits generated in the 2017 through 2020 model years under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1818-12(e)(3)(ii) may not be traded or otherwise provided to another manufacturer. ( v ) Credits generated under any alternative fleet average standards approved under \u00a7 86.1818-12(g) may not be traded or otherwise provided to another manufacturer. ( 8 ) The following provisions apply if a manufacturer calculates that it has negative credits (also called \u201cdebits\u201d or a \u201ccredit deficit\u201d) for a given model year: ( i ) The manufacturer may carry the credit deficit forward into the next three model years. Such a carry-forward may only occur after the manufacturer exhausts any supply of banked credits. The deficit must be covered with an appropriate number of credits that the manufacturer generates or purchases by the end of the third model year. Any remaining deficit is subject to a voiding of the certificate ab initio, as described in this paragraph (k)(8) . Manufacturers are not permitted to have a credit deficit for four consecutive years. ( ii ) If the credit deficit is not offset within the specified time period, the number of vehicles not meeting the fleet average CO 2 standards (and therefore not covered by the certificate) must be calculated. ( A ) Determine the negative credits for the noncompliant vehicle category by multiplying the total megagram deficit by 1,000,000 and then dividing by the mileage specified in paragraph (k)(4) of this section. ( B ) Divide the result by the fleet average standard applicable to the model year in which the debits were first incurred and round to the nearest whole number to determine the number of vehicles not meeting the fleet average CO 2 standards. ( iii ) EPA will determine the vehicles not covered by a certificate because the condition on the certificate was not satisfied by designating vehicles in those test groups with the highest carbon-related exhaust emission values first and continuing until reaching a number of vehicles equal to the calculated number of non-complying vehicles as determined in this paragraph (k)(8) . The same approach applies for HDV, except that EPA will make these designations by ranking test groups based on CO 2 emission values. If these calculations determines that only a portion of vehicles in a test group contribute to the debit situation, then EPA will designate actual vehicles in that test group as not covered by the certificate, starting with the last vehicle produced and counting backwards. ( iv ) ( A ) If a manufacturer ceases production of passenger automobiles, light trucks, or heavy-duty vehicles, the manufacturer continues to be responsible for offsetting any debits outstanding within the required time period. Any failure to offset the debits will be considered a violation of paragraph (k)(8)(i) of this section and may subject the manufacturer to an enforcement action for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate, pursuant to paragraphs (k)(8)(ii) and (iii) of this section. ( B ) If a manufacturer is purchased by, merges with, or otherwise combines with another manufacturer, the controlling entity is responsible for offsetting any debits outstanding within the required time period. Any failure to offset the debits will be considered a violation of paragraph (k)(8)(i) of this section and may subject the manufacturer to an enforcement action for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate, pursuant to paragraphs (k)(8)(ii) and (iii) of this section. ( v ) For purposes of calculating the statute of limitations, a violation of the requirements of paragraph (k)(8)(i) of this section, a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which a certificate(s) was issued and hence a sale of vehicles not covered by the certificate, all occur upon the expiration of the deadline for offsetting debits specified in paragraph (k)(8)(i) of this section. ( 9 ) The following provisions apply to CO 2 credit trading: ( i ) EPA may reject CO 2 credit trades if the involved manufacturers fail to submit the credit trade notification in the annual report. ( ii ) A manufacturer may not sell credits that are no longer valid for demonstrating compliance based on the model years of the subject vehicles, as specified in paragraph (k)(6) of this section. ( iii ) In the event of a negative credit balance resulting from a transaction, both the buyer and seller are liable for the credit shortfall. EPA may void ab initio the certificates of conformity of all test groups that generate or use credits in such a trade. ( iv ) ( A ) If a manufacturer trades a credit that it has not generated pursuant to this paragraph (k) or acquired from another party, the manufacturer will be considered to have generated a debit in the model year that the manufacturer traded the credit. The manufacturer must offset such debits by the deadline for the annual report for that same model year. ( B ) Failure to offset the debits within the required time period will be considered a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the certificate(s) was issued and will be addressed pursuant to paragraph (k)(8) of this section. ( v ) A manufacturer may only trade credits that it has generated pursuant to paragraphs (k)(4) and (5) of this section or acquired from another party. ( 10 ) A manufacturer may generate CO 2 credits from model year 2027 through 2032 electric vehicles that qualify as MDPV and use those credits for certifying medium-duty vehicles, as follows: ( i ) Determine the emission standards from \u00a7 86.1818-12 for qualifying vehicles based on the CO 2 target values for light trucks and the footprint for each vehicle. ( ii ) Calculate generated credits separately for qualifying vehicles as described in paragraph (k)(4) of this section based on the emission standards from paragraph (k)(10)(i) of this section, the mileage values for light trucks, and the total number of qualifying vehicles produced, with fleet average CO 2 emissions set to 0. ( iii ) Apply generated credits to eliminate any deficit for light trucks before using them to certify medium-duty vehicles. ( iv ) Apply the credit provisions of this section as specified, except that you may not buy or sell credits generated under this paragraph (k)(10) . ( v ) Describe in the annual credit reports how you are generating certain credit quantities under this paragraph (k)(10) . Also describe in your end of year credit report how you will use those credits for certifying light trucks or medium-duty vehicles in a given model year. ( l ) Maintenance of records and submittal of information relevant to compliance with fleet average CO 2 standards \u2014 ( 1 ) Maintenance of records. ( i ) Manufacturers producing any light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, medium-duty passenger vehicles, or other heavy-duty vehicles subject to the provisions in this subpart must establish, maintain, and retain all the following information in adequately organized records for each model year: ( A ) Model year. ( B ) Applicable fleet average CO 2 standards for each averaging set as defined in paragraph (i) of this section. ( C ) The calculated fleet average CO 2 value for each averaging set as defined in paragraph (i) of this section. ( D ) All values used in calculating the fleet average CO 2 values. ( ii ) Manufacturers must establish, maintain, and retain all the following information in adequately organized records for each vehicle produced that is subject to the provisions in this subpart: ( A ) Model year. ( B ) Applicable fleet average CO 2 standard. ( C ) EPA test group. ( D ) Assembly plant. ( E ) Vehicle identification number. ( F ) Carbon-related exhaust emission standard (automobile and light truck only), N 2 O emission standard, and CH 4 emission standard to which the vehicle is certified. ( G ) In-use carbon-related exhaust emission standard for passenger automobiles and light truck, and in-use CO 2 standard for HDV. ( H ) Information on the point of first sale, including the purchaser, city, and state. ( iii ) Manufacturers must retain all required records for a period of eight years from the due date for the annual report. Records may be stored in any format and on any media, as long as manufacturers can promptly send EPA organized written records in English if requested by the Administrator. Manufacturers must keep records readily available as EPA may review them at any time. ( iv ) The Administrator may require the manufacturer to retain additional records or submit information not specifically required by this section. ( v ) Pursuant to a request made by the Administrator, the manufacturer must submit to the Administrator the information that the manufacturer is required to retain. ( vi ) EPA may void ab initio a certificate of conformity for vehicles certified to emission standards as set forth or otherwise referenced in this subpart for which the manufacturer fails to retain the records required in this section or to provide such information to the Administrator upon request, or to submit the reports required in this section in the specified time period. ( 2 ) Reporting. ( i ) Each manufacturer must submit an annual report. The annual report must contain for each applicable CO 2 standard, the calculated fleet average CO 2 value, all values required to calculate the CO 2 emissions value, the number of credits generated or debits incurred, all the values required to calculate the credits or debits, and the resulting balance of credits or debits. For each applicable alternative N 2 O and/or CH 4 standard selected under the provisions of \u00a7 86.1818-12(f)(3) for passenger automobiles and light trucks (or \u00a7 86.1819-14(c) for HDV), the report must contain the CO 2 -equivalent debits for N 2 O and/or CH 4 calculated according to \u00a7 86.1818-12(f)(4) (or \u00a7 86.1819-14(c) for HDV) for each test group and all values required to calculate the number of debits incurred. ( ii ) For each applicable fleet average CO 2 standard, the annual report must also include documentation on all credit transactions the manufacturer has engaged in since those included in the last report. Information for each transaction must include all of the following: ( A ) Name of credit provider. ( B ) Name of credit recipient. ( C ) Date the trade occurred. ( D ) Quantity of credits traded in megagrams. ( E ) Model year in which the credits were earned. ( iii ) Manufacturers calculating air conditioning leakage and/or efficiency credits under paragraph \u00a7 86.1871-12(b) shall include the following information for each model year and separately for passenger automobiles and light trucks and for each air conditioning system used to generate credits: ( A ) A description of the air conditioning system. ( B ) The leakage credit value and all the information required to determine this value. ( C ) The total credits earned for each averaging set, model year, and region, as applicable. ( iv ) Manufacturers calculating advanced technology vehicle credits under paragraph \u00a7 86.1871-12(c) shall include the following information for each model year and separately for passenger automobiles and light trucks: ( A ) The number of each model type of eligible vehicle sold. ( B ) The cumulative model year production of eligible vehicles starting with the 2009 model year. ( C ) The carbon-related exhaust emission value by model type and model year. ( v ) Manufacturers calculating off-cycle technology credits under paragraph \u00a7 86.1871-12(d) shall include, for each model year and separately for passenger automobiles and light trucks, all test results and data required for calculating such credits. ( vi ) Unless a manufacturer reports the data required by this section in the annual production report required under \u00a7 86.1844-01(e) or the annual report required under \u00a7 600.512-12 of this chapter , a manufacturer must submit an annual report for each model year after production ends for all affected vehicles produced by the manufacturer subject to the provisions of this subpart and no later than May 1 of the calendar year following the given model year. Annual reports must be submitted to: Director, Compliance Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2000 Traverwood Dr., Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105. ( vii ) Failure by a manufacturer to submit the annual report in the specified time period for all vehicles subject to the provisions in this section is a violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7522 (a)(1)) for each applicable vehicle produced by that manufacturer. ( viii ) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error occurred on an annual report previously submitted to EPA, the manufacturer's credit or debit calculations will be recalculated. EPA may void erroneous credits, unless traded, and will adjust erroneous debits. In the case of traded erroneous credits, EPA must adjust the selling manufacturer's credit balance to reflect the sale of such credits and any resulting credit deficit. ( 3 ) Notice of opportunity for hearing. Any voiding of the certificate under paragraph (l)(1)(vi) of this section will be made only after EPA has offered the affected manufacturer an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with 40 CFR part 1068, subpart G , and, if a manufacturer requests such a hearing, will be made only after an initial decision by the Presiding Officer. [ 81 FR 73992 , Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 85 FR 22620 , Apr. 23, 2020; 86 FR 74524 , Dec. 30, 2021; 89 FR 28193 , Apr. 18, 2024] \u00a7 86.1866-12 CO 2 credits for advanced technology vehicles. This section describes how to apply CO 2 credits for advanced technology passenger automobiles and light trucks (including MDPV). This section does not apply for heavy-duty vehicles that are not MDPV. ( a ) Battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles that are certified and produced for sale in the states and territories of the United States may use a value of zero grams CO 2 per mile to represent the proportion of electric operation of a vehicle that is derived from electricity generated from sources that are not onboard the vehicle. ( b ) For electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, dedicated natural gas vehicles, and dual-fuel natural gas vehicles as those terms are defined in \u00a7 86.1803-01 , that are certified and produced for U.S. sale in the specified model years and that meet the additional specifications in this section, the manufacturer may use the production multipliers in this paragraph (b) when determining additional credits for advanced technology vehicles. Full size pickup trucks eligible for and using a production multiplier are not eligible for the strong hybrid-based credits described in \u00a7 86.1870-12(a)(2) or the performance-based credits described in \u00a7 86.1870-12(b) . ( 1 ) The following production multipliers apply for model year 2017 through 2025 vehicles: Table 1 to Paragraph (b)(1) Model year Electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles Dedicated and dual-fuel natural gas vehicles 2017 2.0 1.6 1.6 2018 2.0 1.6 1.6 2019 2.0 1.6 1.6 2020 1.75 1.45 1.45 2021 1.5 1.3 1.3 2022 2.0 2023-2024 1.5 1.3 ( 2 ) The minimum all-electric driving range that a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle must have in order to qualify for use of a production multiplier is 10.2 miles on its nominal storage capacity of electricity when operated on the highway fuel economy test cycle. Alternatively, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle may qualify for use of a production multiplier by having an equivalent all-electric driving range greater than or equal to 10.2 miles during its actual charge-depleting range as measured on the highway fuel economy test cycle and tested according to the requirements of SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in \u00a7 86.1 ). The equivalent all-electric range of a PHEV is determined from the following formula: EAER = R CDA \u00d7 (CO 2CS \u2212 CO 2CD /CO 2CS ) Where: EAER = the equivalent all-electric range attributed to charge-depleting operation of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle on the highway fuel economy test cycle. R CDA = The actual charge-depleting range determined according to SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in \u00a7 86.1 ). CO 2CS = The charge-sustaining CO 2 emissions in grams per mile on the highway fuel economy test determined according to SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in \u00a7 86.1 ). CO 2CD = The charge-depleting CO 2 emissions in grams per mile on the highway fuel economy test determined according to SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in \u00a7 86.1 ). ( 3 ) The actual production of qualifying vehicles may be multiplied by the applicable value according to the model year, and the result, rounded to the nearest whole number, may be used to represent the production of qualifying vehicles when calculating average carbon-related exhaust emissions under \u00a7 600.512 of this chapter . ( c ) Calculating multiplier-based credits for advanced technology vehicles: This paragraph (c) describes the method for calculating credits using the production multipliers in paragraph (b) of this section. Production multipliers must be used according to this paragraph (c) and must not be used in calculating fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions under 40 CFR part 600 or \u00a7 86.1865-12(i) , or in any elements of the equation used for the calculation of CO 2 credits or debits in \u00a7 86.1865-12(k)(4) . Calculate credits for advanced technology vehicles for a given model year, and separately for passenger automobiles and light trucks, using the following equation, subtracting the credits calculated for the base fleet from the credits calculated for the fleet with multipliers applied. No credits are earned if the result is a negative value. All values expressed in megagrams shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. Credits [ Mg ] = [ Credits adj ]\u2212[ Credits base ] ( 1 ) For model year 2017-2021 multipliers, determine adjusted fleet credits (Credits adj ) in megagrams using one of the following methods, where the resulting Credits adj is rounded to the nearest whole number.

For 2022 and later model years, determine adjusted fleet credits (Credits adj ) in megagrams using only Method 1 in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, where the resulting Credits adj is rounded to the nearest whole number. Note that the adjusted CO 2 standard (S adj ) and the adjusted fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions (E adj ) are determined solely for the purpose of calculating advanced technology vehicle credits in this section; the official CO 2 standard applicable to the fleet will continue to be the value calculated and rounded according to \u00a7 86.1818-12(c) , and the official fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions applicable to the fleet will continue to be the value calculated and rounded according to 40 CFR 600.510-12(j) .

Manufacturers may generate credits applicable to the CO 2 fleet average program described in \u00a7 86.1865-12 by implementing specific air conditioning system technologies designed to reduce air conditioning-related CO 2 emissions over the useful life of their passenger automobiles and light trucks (including MDPV). The provisions of this section do not apply for medium-duty vehicles. Credits shall be calculated according to this section for each air conditioning system that the manufacturer is using to generate CO 2 credits. Manufacturers must validate credits under this section based on testing as described in paragraph (g) of this section. Starting in model year 2027, manufacturers may generate credits under this section only for vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines. ( a ) Air conditioning efficiency credits are available for the following technologies in the gram per mile amounts indicated for each vehicle category in the following table: Table 1 to Paragraph (a) \u2014Technology-Specific Air Conditioning Efficiency Credits [g/mile] Air conditioning technology Passenger automobiles Light trucks Reduced reheat, with externally controlled, variable-displacement compressor ( e.g., a compressor that controls displacement based on temperature setpoint and/or cooling demand of the air conditioning system control settings inside the passenger compartment) 1.5 2.2 Reduced reheat, with externally controlled, fixed-displacement or pneumatic variable displacement compressor ( e.g., a compressor that controls displacement based on conditions within, or internal to, the air conditioning system, such as head pressure, suction pressure, or evaporator outlet temperature) 1.0 1.4 Default to recirculated air with closed-loop control of the air supply (sensor feedback to control interior air quality) whenever the ambient temperature is 75 \u00b0F or higher: Air conditioning systems that operated with closed-loop control of the air supply at different temperatures may receive credits by submitting an engineering analysis to the Administrator for approval 1.5 2.2 Default to recirculated air with open-loop control air supply (no sensor feedback) whenever the ambient temperature is 75 \u00b0F or higher. Air conditioning systems that operate with open-loop control of the air supply at different temperatures may receive credits by submitting an engineering analysis to the Administrator for approval 1.0 1.4 Blower motor controls which limit wasted electrical energy ( e.g., pulse width modulated power controller) 0.8 1.1 Internal heat exchanger ( e.g., a device that transfers heat from the high-pressure, liquid-phase refrigerant entering the evaporator to the low-pressure, gas-phase refrigerant exiting the evaporator) 1.0 1.4 Improved condensers and/or evaporators with system analysis on the component(s) indicating a coefficient of performance improvement for the system of greater than 10% when compared to previous industry standard designs) 1.0 1.4 Oil separator. The manufacturer must submit an engineering analysis demonstrating the increased improvement of the system relative to the baseline design, where the baseline component for comparison is the version which a manufacturer most recently had in production on the same vehicle design or in a similar or related vehicle model. The characteristics of the baseline component shall be compared to the new component to demonstrate the improvement 0.5 0.7 Advanced technology air conditioning compressor with improved efficiency relative to fixed-displacement compressors achieved through the addition of a variable crankcase suction valve 1.1 1.1 ( b ) Air conditioning efficiency credits are determined on an air conditioning system basis. For each air conditioning system that is eligible for a credit based on the use of one or more of the items listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the total credit value is the sum of the gram per mile values for the appropriate model year listed in paragraph (a) for each item that applies to the air conditioning system. The total credit value for an air conditioning system may not be greater than 5.0 grams per mile for any passenger automobile or 7.2 grams per mile for any light truck. ( c ) The total efficiency credits generated by an air conditioning system shall be calculated in megagrams separately for passenger automobiles and light trucks according to the following formula: Equation 1 to Paragraph (c) Where: Credit = the CO 2 efficiency credit value in grams per mile determined in paragraph (b) of this section, whichever is applicable. Starting in model year 2027, multiply the credit value for PHEV by (1-UF), where UF = the fleet utility factor established under 40 CFR 600.116-12(c)(1) or (c)(10)(iii) (weighted 55 percent city, 45 percent highway. Production = The total number of passenger automobiles or light trucks, whichever is applicable, produced with the air conditioning system to which to the efficiency credit value from paragraph (b) of this section applies. VLM = vehicle lifetime miles, which for passenger automobiles shall be 195,264 and for light trucks shall be 225,865. ( d ) The results of paragraph (c) of this section, rounded to the nearest whole number, shall be included in the manufacturer's credit/debit totals calculated in \u00a7 86.1865-12(k)(5) . ( e ) - ( f ) [Reserved] ( g ) For AC17 validation testing and reporting requirements, manufacturers must validate air conditioning credits by using the AC17 Test Procedure in 40 CFR 1066.845 as follows: ( 1 ) For each air conditioning system (as defined in \u00a7 86.1803 ) selected by the manufacturer to generate air conditioning efficiency credits, the manufacturer shall perform the AC17 Air Conditioning Efficiency Test Procedure specified in 40 CFR 1066.845 , according to the requirements of this paragraph (g) . ( 2 ) Complete the following testing and calculations: ( i ) Perform the AC17 test on a vehicle that incorporates the air conditioning system with the credit-generating technologies. ( ii ) Perform the AC17 test on a vehicle which does not incorporate the credit-generating technologies. The tested vehicle must be similar to the vehicle tested under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section and selected using good engineering judgment. The tested vehicle may be from an earlier design generation. If the manufacturer cannot identify an appropriate vehicle to test under this paragraph (g)(2)(ii) , they may submit an engineering analysis that describes why an appropriate vehicle is not available or not appropriate, and includes data and information supporting specific credit values, using good engineering judgment. ( iii ) Subtract the CO 2 emissions determined from testing under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section from the CO 2 emissions determined from testing under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section and round to the nearest 0.1 grams/mile. If the result is less than or equal to zero, the air conditioning system is not eligible to generate credits. If the result is greater than or equal to the total of the gram per mile credits determined in paragraph (b) of this section, then the air conditioning system is eligible to generate the maximum allowable value determined in paragraph (b) of this section. If the result is greater than zero but less than the total of the gram per mile credits determined in paragraph (b) of this section, then the air conditioning system is eligible to generate credits in the amount determined by subtracting the CO 2 emissions determined from testing under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section from the CO 2 emissions determined from testing under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section and rounding to the nearest 0.1 grams/mile. ( 3 ) For the first model year for which an air conditioning system is expected to generate credits, the manufacturer must select for testing the projected highest-selling configuration within each combination of vehicle platform and air conditioning system (as those terms are defined in \u00a7 86.1803 ). The manufacturer must test at least one unique air conditioning system within each vehicle platform in a model year, unless all unique air conditioning systems within a vehicle platform have been previously tested. A unique air conditioning system design is a system with unique or substantially different component designs or types and/or system control strategies ( e.g., fixed-displacement vs. variable displacement compressors, orifice tube vs. thermostatic expansion valve, single vs. dual evaporator, etc.). In the first year of such testing, the tested vehicle configuration shall be the highest production vehicle configuration within each platform. In subsequent model years the manufacturer must test other unique air conditioning systems within the vehicle platform, proceeding from the highest production untested system until all unique air conditioning systems within the platform have been tested, or until the vehicle platform experiences a major redesign. Whenever a new unique air conditioning system is tested, the highest production configuration using that system shall be the vehicle selected for testing. Credits may continue to be generated by the air conditioning system installed in a vehicle platform provided that: ( i ) The air conditioning system components and/or control strategies do not change in any way that could be expected to cause a change in its efficiency; ( ii ) The vehicle platform does not change in design such that the changes could be expected to cause a change in the efficiency of the air conditioning system; and ( iii ) The manufacturer continues to test at least one unique air conditioning system within each platform using the air conditioning system, in each model year, until all unique air conditioning systems within each platform have been tested. ( 4 ) Each air conditioning system must be tested and must meet the testing criteria in order to be allowed to generate credits. Credits may continue to be generated by an air conditioning system in subsequent model years if the manufacturer continues to test at least one unique air conditioning system within each platform on an annual basis, unless all systems have been previously tested, as long as the air conditioning system and vehicle platform do not change substantially. ( 5 ) AC17 testing requirements apply as follows for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles: ( i ) Manufacturers may omit AC17 testing for electric vehicles. Electric vehicles may qualify for air conditioning efficiency credits based on identified technologies, without testing. The application for certification must include a detailed description of the vehicle's air conditioning system and identify any technology items eligible for air conditioning efficiency credits. Include additional supporting information to justify the air conditioning credit for each technology. ( ii ) The provisions of paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section also apply for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles if they have an all electric range of at least 60 miles (combined city and highway) after adjustment to reflect actual in-use driving conditions (see 40 CFR 600.311(j) ), and they do not rely on the engine to cool the vehicle's cabin for the ambient and driving conditions represented by the AC17 test. ( iii ) If AC17 testing is required for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, perform this testing in charge-sustaining mode. ( h ) The following definitions apply to this section: ( 1 ) Reduced reheat, with externally-controlled, variable displacement compressor means a system in which compressor displacement is controlled via an electronic signal, based on input from sensors ( e.g., position or setpoint of interior temperature control, interior temperature, evaporator outlet air temperature, or refrigerant temperature) and air temperature at the outlet of the evaporator can be controlled to a level at 41 \u00b0F, or higher. ( 2 ) Reduced reheat, with externally-controlled, fixed-displacement or pneumatic variable displacement compressor means a system in which the output of either compressor is controlled by cycling the compressor clutch off-and-on via an electronic signal, based on input from sensors ( e.g., position or setpoint of interior temperature control, interior temperature, evaporator outlet air temperature, or refrigerant temperature) and air temperature at the outlet of the evaporator can be controlled to a level at 41 \u00b0F, or higher. ( 3 ) Default to recirculated air mode means that the default position of the mechanism which controls the source of air supplied to the air conditioning system shall change from outside air to recirculated air when the operator or the automatic climate control system has engaged the air conditioning system ( i.e., evaporator is removing heat), except under those conditions where dehumidification is required for visibility ( i.e., defogger mode). In vehicles equipped with interior air quality sensors ( e.g., humidity sensor, or carbon dioxide sensor), the controls may determine proper blend of air supply sources to maintain freshness of the cabin air and prevent fogging of windows while continuing to maximize the use of recirculated air. At any time, the vehicle operator may manually select the non-recirculated air setting during vehicle operation but the system must default to recirculated air mode on subsequent vehicle operations ( i.e., next vehicle start). The climate control system may delay switching to recirculation mode until the interior air temperature is less than the outside air temperature, at which time the system must switch to recirculated air mode. ( 4 ) Blower motor controls which limit waste energy means a method of controlling fan and blower speeds which does not use resistive elements to decrease the voltage supplied to the motor. ( 5 ) Improved condensers and/or evaporators means that the coefficient of performance (COP) of air conditioning system using improved evaporator and condenser designs is 10 percent higher, as determined using the bench test procedures described in SAE J2765 (incorporated by reference, see \u00a7 86.1 ), when compared to a system using standard, or prior model year, component designs. The manufacturer must submit an engineering analysis demonstrating the increased improvement of the system relative to the baseline design, where the baseline component(s) for comparison is the version which a manufacturer most recently had in production on the same vehicle design or in a similar or related vehicle model. The dimensional characteristics ( e.g., tube configuration/thickness/spacing, and fin density) of the baseline component(s) shall be compared to the new component(s) to demonstrate the improvement in coefficient of performance. ( 6 ) Oil separator means a mechanism which removes at least 50 percent of the oil entrained in the oil/refrigerant mixture exiting the compressor and returns it to the compressor housing or compressor inlet, or a compressor design which does not rely on the circulation of an oil/refrigerant mixture for lubrication. ( 7 ) Advanced technology air conditioning compressor means an air conditioning compressor with improved efficiency relative to fixed-displacement compressors. Efficiency gains are derived from improved internal valve systems that optimize the internal refrigerant flow across the range of compressor operator conditions through the addition of a variable crankcase suction valve.

This section describes how manufacturers may generate credits for off-cycle CO 2 -reducing technologies through model year 2032. The provisions of this section do not apply for medium-duty vehicles, except that \u00a7 86.1819-14(d)(13) describes how to apply paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section for those vehicles. Manufacturers may no longer generate credits under this section starting in model year 2027 for vehicles deemed to have zero tailpipe emissions and in model year 2033 for all other vehicles. Manufacturers may no longer generate credits under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section for any type of vehicle starting in model year 2027. ( a ) Manufacturers may generate credits for CO 2 -reducing technologies where the CO 2 reduction benefit of the technology is not adequately captured on the Federal Test Procedure and/or the Highway Fuel Economy Test such that the technology would not be otherwise installed for purposes of reducing emissions (directly or indirectly) over those test cycles for compliance with the GHG standards. These technologies must have a measurable, demonstrable, and verifiable real-world CO 2 reduction that occurs outside the conditions of the Federal Test Procedure and the Highway Fuel Economy Test. These optional credits are referred to as \u201coff-cycle\u201d credits. The technologies must not be integral or inherent to the basic vehicle design, such as engine, transmission, mass reduction, passive aerodynamic design, and tire technologies. Technologies installed for non-off-cycle emissions related reasons are also not eligible as they would be considered part of the baseline vehicle design. The technology must not be inherent to the design of occupant comfort and entertainment features except for technologies related to reducing passenger air conditioning demand and improving air conditioning system efficiency. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (a) , off-cycle menu technologies included in paragraph (b) of this section remain eligible for credits. Off-cycle technologies used to generate emission credits are considered emission-related components subject to applicable requirements and must be demonstrated to be effective for the full useful life of the vehicle. Unless the manufacturer demonstrates that the technology is not subject to in-use deterioration, the manufacturer must account for the deterioration in their analysis. Durability evaluations of off-cycle technologies may occur at any time throughout a model year, provided that the results can be factored into the data provided in the model year report.

( 2 ) The maximum allowable decrease in the manufacturer's combined passenger automobile and light truck fleet average CO 2 emissions attributable to use of the default credit values in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is specified in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. If the total of the CO 2 g/mi credit values from paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not exceed the specified off-cycle credit cap for any passenger automobile or light truck in a manufacturer's fleet, then the total off-cycle credits may be calculated according to paragraph (f) of this section. If the total of the CO 2 g/mi credit values from paragraph (b)(1) of this section exceeds the specified off-cycle credit cap for any passenger automobile or light truck in a manufacturer's fleet, then the gram per mile decrease for the combined passenger automobile and light truck fleet must be determined according to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to determine whether the applicable limitation has been exceeded.

( iii ) If the value determined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is not greater than the off-cycle credit cap specified in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, then the credits that may be accrued by a manufacturer using the default gram per mile values in paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not exceed the allowable limit, and total credits may be determined for each category of vehicles according to paragraph (f) of this section. ( iv ) If the value determined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is greater than the off-cycle credit cap specified in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, then the combined passenger automobile and light truck credits, in Megagrams, that may be accrued using the calculations in paragraph (f) of this section must not exceed the value determined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. This limitation should generally be done by reducing the amount of credits attributable to the vehicle category that caused the limit to be exceeded such that the total value does not exceed the value determined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. ( v ) The manufacturer's combined passenger automobile and light truck fleet average CO 2 emissions attributable to use of the default credit values in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may not exceed the following specific values: Model year Off-cycle credit cap (g/mile) (A) 2023-2026 15 (B) 2027-2030 10 (C) 2031 8.0 (D) 2032 6.0 ( 3 ) In lieu of using the default gram per mile values specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for specific technologies, a manufacturer may determine an alternative value for any of the specified technologies.

( B ) Starting in model year 2023, active transmission warm-up means a system that uses waste heat from the vehicle's exhaust to warm the transmission fluid to an operating temperature range using a dedicated heat exchanger. Active transmission warm-up may also include coolant systems that capture heat from a liquid-cooled exhaust manifold if the coolant loop to the transmission heat exchanger is not shared with other heat-extracting systems and it starts heat transfer to the transmission fluid immediately after engine starting, consistent with designs that exchange heat directly from exhaust gases to the transmission fluid. ( vi ) Active engine warm-up means one of the following: ( A ) Through model year 2022, active engine warm-up means a system that uses waste heat from the vehicle to warm up targeted parts of the engine so it reduces engine friction losses and enables closed-loop fuel control to start sooner. ( B ) Starting in model year 2023, active engine warm-up means a system that uses waste heat from the vehicle's exhaust to warm up targeted parts of the engine so it reduces engine friction losses and enables closed-loop fuel control to start sooner. Active engine warm-up may also include coolant systems that capture heat from a liquid-cooled exhaust manifold.

( xiii ) High efficiency alternator means an alternator where the ratio of the alternator output power to the power supplied to the alternator is greater than 67 percent, as measured using the Verband der Automobilindustrie (VDA) efficiency measurement methodology. ( c ) Technology demonstration using EPA 5-cycle methodology. To demonstrate an off-cycle technology and to determine a CO 2 credit using the EPA 5-cycle methodology, the manufacturer shall determine the off-cycle city/highway combined carbon-related exhaust emissions benefit by using the EPA 5-cycle methodology described in 40 CFR Part 600 . This method may not be used for technologies that include elements (e.g., driver-selectable systems) that require additional analyses, data collection, projections, or modeling, or other assessments to determine a national average benefit of the technology. Testing shall be performed on a representative vehicle, selected using good engineering judgment, for each model type for which the credit is being demonstrated. The emission benefit of a technology is determined by testing both with and without the off-cycle technology operating. If a specific technology is not expected to change emissions on one of the five test procedures, the manufacturer may submit an engineering analysis to the EPA that demonstrates that the technology has no effect. If EPA concurs with the analysis, then multiple tests are not required using that test procedure; instead, only one of that test procedure shall be required\u2014either with or without the technology installed and operating\u2014and that single value will be used for all of the 5-cycle weighting calculations. Multiple off-cycle technologies may be demonstrated on a test vehicle. The manufacturer shall conduct the following steps and submit all test data to the EPA. ( 1 ) Testing without the off-cycle technology installed and/or operating. ( i ) Determine carbon-related exhaust emissions over the FTP, the HFET, the US06, the SC03, and the cold temperature FTP test procedures according to the test procedure provisions specified in 40 CFR part 600 subpart B and using the calculation procedures specified in 40 CFR 600.113-12 . Run each of these tests a minimum of three times without the off-cycle technology installed and operating and average the per phase (bag) results for each test procedure. ( ii ) Calculate the FTP and HFET carbon-related exhaust emissions from the FTP and HFET averaged per phase results. ( iii ) Calculate the combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emission value from the FTP and HFET values determined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, where the FTP value is weighted 55% and the HFET value is weighted 45%. The resulting value is the 2-cycle unadjusted combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emissions value for the vehicle without the off-cycle technology. ( iv ) Calculate the 5-cycle weighted city/highway combined carbon-related exhaust emissions from the averaged per phase results, where the 5-cycle city value is weighted 55% and the 5-cycle highway value is weighted 45%. The resulting value is the 5-cycle adjusted combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emission value for the vehicle without the off-cycle technology. ( 2 ) Testing with the off-cycle technology installed and/or operating. ( i ) Determine carbon-related exhaust emissions over the FTP, the HFET, the US06, the SC03, and the cold temperature FTP test procedures according to the test procedure provisions specified in 40 CFR part 600 subpart B and using the calculation procedures specified in 40 CFR 600.113-12 . Run each of these tests a minimum of three times with the off-cycle technology installed and operating and average the per phase (bag) results for each test procedure. ( ii ) Calculate the FTP and HFET carbon-related exhaust emissions from the FTP and HFET averaged per phase results. ( iii ) Calculate the combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emission value from the FTP and HFET values determined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, where the FTP value is weighted 55% and the HFET value is weighted 45%. The resulting value is the 2-cycle unadjusted combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emissions value for the vehicle with the off-cycle technology. ( iv ) Calculate the 5-cycle weighted city/highway combined carbon-related exhaust emissions from the averaged per phase results, where the 5-cycle city value is weighted 55% and the 5-cycle highway value is weighted 45%. The resulting value is the 5-cycle adjusted combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emission value for the vehicle with the off-cycle technology. ( 3 ) Calculate the off-cycle credit in grams per mile using the following formula, rounding the result to the nearest 0.1 grams/mile: Credit = ( A\u2212B )\u2212( C\u2212D ) Where: Credit = the off-cycle benefit of the technology or technologies being evaluated, subject to EPA approval; A = the 5-cycle adjusted combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emission value for the vehicle without the off-cycle technology, as calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section; B = 5-cycle adjusted combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emission value for the vehicle with the off-cycle technology, as calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section; C = 2-cycle unadjusted combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emissions value for the vehicle without the off-cycle technology, as calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section; and D = 2-cycle unadjusted combined city/highway carbon-related exhaust emissions value for the vehicle with the off-cycle technology, as calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. ( 4 ) Submit all test values to EPA, and include an engineering analysis describing the technology and how it provides off-cycle emission benefits. EPA may request additional testing if we determine that additional testing would be likely to provide significantly greater confidence in the estimates of off-cycle technology benefits. ( d ) Technology demonstration using alternative EPA-approved methodology. ( 1 ) This option may be used only with EPA approval, and the manufacturer must be able to justify to the Administrator why the 5-cycle option described in paragraph (c) of this section insufficiently characterizes the effectiveness of the off-cycle technology. In cases where the EPA 5-cycle methodology described in paragraph (c) of this section cannot adequately measure the emission reduction attributable to an off-cycle technology, the manufacturer may develop an alternative approach. Prior to a model year in which a manufacturer intends to seek these credits, the manufacturer must submit a detailed analytical plan to EPA. The manufacturer may seek EPA input on the proposed methodology prior to conducting testing or analytical work, and EPA will provide input on the manufacturer's analytical plan. The alternative demonstration program must be approved in advance by the Administrator and should: ( i ) Use modeling, on-road testing, on-road data collection, or other approved analytical or engineering methods; ( ii ) Be robust, verifiable, and capable of demonstrating the real-world emissions benefit with strong statistical significance; ( iii ) Result in a demonstration of baseline and controlled emissions over a wide range of driving conditions and number of vehicles such that issues of data uncertainty are minimized; ( iv ) Result in data on a model type basis unless the manufacturer demonstrates that another basis is appropriate and adequate. ( 2 ) Notice and opportunity for public comment. ( i ) The Administrator will publish a notice of availability in the Federal Register notifying the public of a manufacturer's proposed alternative off-cycle credit calculation methodology. The notice will include details regarding the proposed methodology but will not include any Confidential Business Information (see 40 CFR 1068.10 and 1068.11 ). The notice will include instructions on how to comment on the methodology. The Administrator will take public comments into consideration in the final determination and will notify the public of the final determination. Credits may not be accrued using an approved methodology until the first model year for which the Administrator has issued a final approval.

To qualify for this waiver, the new application must be substantially identical in form, content, and methodology to the application for a previously approved methodology, and must include the following: ( A ) A citation to the appropriate previously approved methodology, including the appropriate Federal Register Notice and any subsequent EPA documentation of the Administrator's decision; ( B ) All necessary manufacturer- and vehicle-specific test data, modeling, and credit calculations; and, ( C ) Any other vehicle- or technology-specific details required pursuant to the previously approved methodology to assess and support an appropriate credit value. ( iii ) A waiver of the notice and comment requirements does not imply a determination that a specific credit value for a given technology is appropriate, and nor does it imply a waiver from the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (e) of this section. ( iv ) The Administrator retains the option to require a notice and opportunity for public comment in cases where a new application deviates in significant respects from a previously approved methodology or raises novel substantive issues. ( 3 ) With respect to fuel consumption improvement values applicable to the determination of average fuel economy under 600.510-12(c)(3) for the 2017 and later model years, EPA will consult with the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, prior to making a decision on a manufacturer's application submitted under the requirements of this paragraph (d) .

Full-size pickup trucks earning credits under this paragraph (a)(2) may not earn credits based on the production multipliers described in \u00a7 86.1866-12(b) . ( b ) Credits for emission reduction performance. Full size pickup trucks that achieve carbon-related exhaust emission values below the applicable target value determined in \u00a7 86.1818-12(c)(3) may be eligible for an additional credit. For the purposes of this paragraph (b) , carbon-related exhaust emission values may include any applicable air conditioning leakage and/or efficiency credits as determined in \u00a7 86.1867 and \u00a7 86.1868 . Pickup trucks earning the credits under this paragraph (b) may not earn credits described in paragraph (a) of this section and may not earn credits based on the production multipliers described in \u00a7 86.1866-12(b) . ( 1 ) Full size pickup trucks that are produced in the 2017 through 2021 model years and that achieve carbon-related exhaust emissions less than or equal to the applicable target value determined in \u00a7 86.1818-12(c)(3) multiplied by 0.85 (rounded to the nearest gram/mile) and greater than the applicable target value determined in \u00a7 86.1818-12(c)(3) multiplied by 0.80 (rounded to the nearest gram/mile) in a model year are eligible for a credit of 10 grams/mile. A pickup truck that qualifies for this credit in a model year may claim this credit for subsequent model years through the 2021 model year if the carbon-related exhaust emissions of that pickup truck do not increase relative to the emissions in the model year in which the pickup truck qualified for the credit. To qualify for this credit in a model year, the manufacturer must produce a quantity of full size pickup trucks that meet the initial emission eligibility requirements of this paragraph (b)(1) such that the proportion of production of such vehicles, when compared to the manufacturer's total production of full size pickup trucks, is not less than the amount specified in the table below for that model year. Model year Required minimum percent of full size pickup truck (percent) 2017 15 2018 20 2019 28 2020 35 2021 40 ( 2 ) Full-size pickup trucks that are produced in 2017 through 2021 model years and that achieve carbon-related exhaust emissions less than or equal to the applicable target value determined in \u00a7 86.1818-12(c)(3) multiplied by 0.80 (rounded to the nearest gram/mile) in a model year are eligible for a credit of 20 grams/mile. This same credit is available again for qualifying vehicles produced in 2023 and 2024 model years. A pickup truck that qualifies for this credit in a model year may claim this credit for a maximum of four subsequent model years (a total of five consecutive model years) if the carbon-related exhaust emissions of that pickup truck do not increase relative to the emissions in the model year in which the pickup truck first qualified for the credit. This credit may not be claimed in model year 2022 or in any model year after 2024. To qualify for this credit in a model year, the manufacturer must produce a quantity of full-size pickup trucks that meet the emission requirements of this paragraph (b)(2) such that the proportion of production of such vehicles, when compared to the manufacturer's total production of full-size pickup trucks, is not less than 10 percent in that model year. A pickup truck that qualifies for this credit in a model year and is subject to a major redesign in a subsequent model year such that it qualifies for the credit in the model year of the redesign may be allowed to qualify for an additional five years with EPA approval (not to go beyond the 2024 model year). Use good engineering judgment to determine whether a pickup truck has been subject to a major redesign. ( c ) Calculation of total full size pickup truck credits. Total credits in Megagrams of CO 2 (rounded to the nearest whole number) shall be calculated for qualifying full size pickup trucks according to the following formula: Total Credits (Megagrams) = ([(10 \u00d7 Production MHEV ) + (10 \u00d7 Production T15 ) + (20 \u00d7 Production SHEV ) + (20 \u00d7 Production T20 )] \u00d7 225,865) \u00f7 1,000,000 Where: Production MHEV = The total number of mild hybrid electric full size pickup trucks produced with a credit value of 10 grams per mile from paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Production T15 = The total number of full size pickup trucks produced with a performance-based credit value of 10 grams per mile from paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Production SHEV = The total number of strong hybrid electric full size pickup trucks produced with a credit value of 20 grams per mile from paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Production T20 = The total number of full size pickup trucks produced with a performance-based credit value of 20 grams per mile from paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

But those who are interested in becoming carriers or brokers will first need to obtain their MC operating authority. Get Your MC Authority Add Your Heading Text Here < Back to resources August 3, 2023 DAT Carrier, Broker But what is trucking authority exactly, and what requirements must carriers and brokers fulfill to earn their operating license? What are the differences between the two? If you\u2019ve been wondering how to get your own trucking authority or where to get the best trucking authority services, you\u2019ve come to the right place! DAT is your source for all things freight, so let\u2019s go over everything you need to know about MC authority. What is MC trucking authority? MC authority , commonly known as trucking authority or motor carrier authority , means that a trucking company has legal authorization from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to get paid for transporting goods across state lines via their own trucking company and own vehicle. There are other forms of operating authority as well, such as FMCSA broker authority , which grants permission to facilitate loads between shippers and carriers. Once carriers and brokers get approval for their operating authority, FMCSA r egistration will then lead to receiving a unique MC number, which they\u2019ll use to carry out their business efforts. Who needs MC trucking authority? If you\u2019re looking to become a carrier or independent owner-operator with your own authority, you need an MC number to transport goods across state lines. Importantly, carriers will also need a USDOT number, which is a unique identifier given by the FMCSA to collect and monitor a company\u2019s safety information. This can include safety audits, compliance reviews, crash investigations, and inspections. Freight brokers are also required to have their MC authority before being allowed to facilitate loads between shippers and carriers. However, the process is a bit different from what carriers and owner-operators have to do. Freight broker authority doesn\u2019t require a USDOT number, but has a number of other requirements, which aspiring brokers should have a clear understanding of so they can get their brokerage started off smoothly. Who does not need MC authority? While many carriers are required to get their FMCSA authority , not all of them are. Intrastate carriers, meaning carriers who only operate within the state their company is located, are not required to get an MC number since they are not crossing state borders (but are still required to get a USDOT number). Additionally, private fleets that are owned and operated by a shipper and never enter into contracts to haul other companies\u2019 freight won\u2019t need MC authority. For-hire carriers, or carriers that transport other people\u2019s freight, will need MC authority for their company drivers and leased-on owner-operators to operate under. Certain for-hire carriers transporting non-regulated cargo and carriers that exclusively work within a commercial zone like the Washington, D.C./Maryland/Virginia area are also exempt from MC authority requirements. Unless you know that you might end up as one of these types of trucking businesses, carriers and brokers should plan to undergo the application process for motor carrier authority. But what exactly does that process look like? How is an MC number different from a USDOT number? One of the major differences in the authority requirements between carriers and brokers is the necessity of obtaining a USDOT number. While brokers do not need a USDOT number for their freight broker authority, a carrier might need both a DOT and MC number, depending on how their business is set up. Carriers are required to get a USDOT number for their trucking authority, whether they are transporting goods across state lines or staying within state boundaries. Meanwhile, an MC number is only needed for interstate operations. If a carrier is only hauling loads within the state where the company is located, they won\u2019t need an MC number. What are the trucking authority requirements? Before anything else, carriers and brokers should be aware of the financial trucking authority costs. While it might seem like a lot upfront, these financial requirements are an investment into the future success of your trucking business or brokerage. This can include buying or leasing a truck, registering your business, paying for insurance, application fees, and more. Here are some other main requirements that should be part of your trucking authority checklist: Proof of insurance coverage: Brokers are required to obtain a surety bond or a trust fund agreement of at least $75,000, in case of accidents. Carriers, likewise, need to show proof of their own insurance coverage. A BOC-3 process agent: A processing agent is an individual or a company that will help you deal with legal documents. It helps the FMCSA easily contact you with any important information, even when you\u2019re away from home base on the road. This is an essential part of starting a trucking business or brokerage and earning your MC authority. Application fees: Brokers must pay a $300 fee when they apply for their FMCSA broker authority. Can you get FMCSA authority without an MC number? We\u2019ve gone over cases where carriers don\u2019t need to earn their trucking authority, but if you do need it, then you\u2019ll need to get an MC number. Brokers are also required to get an MC number to get their authority . But earning your MC authority shouldn\u2019t be a deterrent from starting your own carrier or broker business. In many cases, the upsides of having your own authority are greater than if you were using a larger organization\u2019s operating authority. How to get MC authority Now, let\u2019s go through each step required for your trucking authority checklist. Establish your business When you apply for your MC authority, the FMCSA registration process will require you to fulfill certain criteria. They\u2019ll be looking at the type of cargo you\u2019re planning to haul, your company type, and more. For that reason, the first thing you need to do is get your Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS and set yourself up as an official business entity. In addition, carriers and brokers will need to be pre-approved for insurance coverage. This is important because if you are denied coverage, you won\u2019t be able to continue with the FMCSA registration process. Apply for your DOT and MC number With your business established and all the initial pieces in place, carriers and brokers can then fill out an FMCSA registration form for their MC authority. This includes providing the business information you should have acquired in the previous step. You\u2019ll also need your truck information, including your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), model year, weight, and more.However, carriers should get their USDOT number before they begin their FMCSA registration. Brokers are not required to get DOT numbers. First-time applicants should register via the United Registration System (URS). Once you\u2019ve obtained a USDOT number, carriers can then proceed with getting their MC authority. Choose your BOC-3 process agent For legal purposes, carrier and broker businesses must assign a processing agent \u2014 someone who agrees to accept any court papers or legal documents on behalf of your trucking business or brokerage. This can be either an individual agent or a company that offers process agent services. Once your process agent is in place, you should fill out the BOC-3 form to declare your choice to the FMCSA. File your UCR permit Once carriers have their DOT and MC number (or just their MC number for brokers), the next step is to file for a Universal Carrier Registration permit, or UCR for short. This is to verify that you have active insurance coverage in the states you will be operating in. Since you need to have your insurance already set up when you\u2019re establishing your business, this should be a straightforward task. You\u2019re also required to already have your USDOT and MC number.Despite the name, brokers must also file for a UCR permit, so long as they are helping carriers transport loads across state lines. This is an important step for carrier and broker businesses, as operating without a UCR permit can lead to severe penalties for you and your company. Register for IRP and set up an IFTA account Carriers are required to register for an International Registration Plan (IRP). An IRP is an agreement among 48 states and Canada that lets carriers register their vehicles in one location and then pay apportioned license fees that allow them to operate within other jurisdictions. Fees are based on how much time you operate in each jurisdiction, and can range from $1,500 to $2,000 per vehicle.Carriers must also set up an International Fuel Tax Agreement account, or an IFTA account for short. Carriers are required to register for both an IRP and IFTA account if their vehicles travel between two or more applicable jurisdictions, or if their gross vehicle weight exceeds 26,000 pounds or has three or more axles. Sign up for FMCSA Clearinghouse drug and alcohol testing Finally, carriers need to enroll every driver in their organization in a drug and alcohol testing program, which the FMCSA Clearinghouse registration process requires from every driver with a CDL license. It\u2019s essential that drivers maintain compliance with the FMCSA Clearinghouse rules, regulations and driver safety qualifications. It\u2019s not just for the sake of your business, but for the well-being of your drivers and others on the road.Our trucking authority packages include DAT partner CleanFleet , which offers high-quality testing and comprehensive reporting, so that you can educate employees, avoid fines, and keep everyone safe.
