The industry must take action to reestablish global leadership and ensure success in economics, resilience, and decarbonization. (15 pages) The European automotive industry is a backbone of the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy and welfare. It contributes 7 percent of GDP in the European Union, accounts for about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac170 billion in exports, and employs about 13.8 million people, including through 3.5 million direct and indirect manufacturing jobs\u00e2\u0080\u00948.5 percent of the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total manufacturing talent base. 1 EU trade since 1988 by HS2-4-6 and CN8,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Eurostat, updated August 18, 2025; \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutomotive industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d European Commission, accessed August 29, 2025. In addition, the industry is on a trajectory toward zero emissions. At the same time, new developments in software, gen AI, connectivity, and self-driving technology are reshaping what the industry can offer. Together with decarbonization, this technological disruption represents the largest transformation in the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history and creates opportunities for players across the value chain. 2 For more, see \u00e2\u0080\u009c Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, October 3, 2024. However, the European automotive industry faces headwinds. The technological disruption also creates new requirements, and combined with growing international competition, geopolitical issues, and high factor costs, this has challenged the industry. According to McKinsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent article \u00e2\u0080\u009cEurope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the most disruptive scenario puts \u00e2\u0082\u00ac440 billion in GDP\u00e2\u0080\u0094about one-third of the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0094at risk by 2035. 3 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, October 3, 2024. The scope of these estimates includes the GDP impact on the automotive sector, updating last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reported GVA impact based on latest European Commission estimates for the automotive industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GDP contribution. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Andreas Tschiesner , Andreas Venus , Harald Deubener , Patrick Schaufuss , and Ruth Heuss , with Milo Boers, representing views from McKinsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Automotive & Assembly Practice. Automotive players and their supplier ecosystem, as well as financiers, regulators, and adjacent industries, need to come together to make structural changes and reestablish the region as a leading global automotive powerhouse. In this article, we discuss the challenges facing the industry and lay out a nine-point action plan building on our previous McKinsey report A road map for Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automotive industry. 4 Andreas Cornet, Ruth Heuss, Patrick Schaufuss, and Andreas Tschiesner, A road map for Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automotive industry , McKinsey, August 2023. This action plan is based on three key dimensions that will build a strong foundation for the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future: successful economics, successful resilience, and successful decarbonization (abatement of CO 2 ), forming the acronym \u00e2\u0080\u009cERA.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Additionally, digitalization and AI will be critical as enablers to succeed in this new era. 5 For more, see Europe in the intelligent age: From ideas to action , World Economic Forum in collaboration with McKinsey, January 2025. Headwinds in the European auto industry Although Europe has long maintained a strong global position in the automotive sector, the industry now faces a series of complex and evolving challenges. Technological disruption and transition pressures. Powertrain shifts, digitalization, and software-defined vehicles (SDVs) are reshaping the industry at a fundamental level. McKinsey estimates that 85 to 90 percent of the value added from a typical European internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle contributes to the European economy, dropping to 75 percent for locally produced battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and 15 to 20 percent for imported BEVs. 6 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, October 3, 2024. The transition from ICE to electric drivetrains requires not only retooling production but also redefining value chains and core competencies. Meanwhile, software and electronics\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly in areas in which non-European players are rapidly advancing, such as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), vehicle connectivity, and in-vehicle user experience\u00e2\u0080\u0094are becoming key differentiators. A smooth digital customer experience has also become a nonnegotiable feature for many customers. McKinsey research shows advancements in digitalization and AI increasingly propel global market valuations, with the top ten European automotive companies (passenger car OEMs and suppliers) seeing a \u00e2\u0082\u00ac71 billion drop in valuation since 2015 (a 19 percent reduction), compared to a quadrupling of US tech over the same period, based on the NASDAQ 100 index. Intensifying global competition and emerging tech leaders. European automotive incumbents have lost about a fifth of their global market share since 2017, while new entrants have doubled theirs. 7 Based on data from EV Volumes, S&P Light Vehicle Sales, and McKinsey Center for Future Mobility. As a result, each group now holds about a quarter of the global market. Incumbents face mounting competition, particularly from digitally native new entrants in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. These new players often benefit from faster development cycles, vertically integrated models, and even scale advantages, enabling them to develop increasingly advanced vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0094often at double the speed and half the cost. While European brands still enjoy a strong reputation, the center of innovation is shifting globally, with Asia and North America leading in emerging technologies. Geopolitical and economic headwinds. High energy prices and volatility, particularly following recent geopolitical tensions, has made manufacturing in Europe more costly relative to other global regions; average European energy costs are double those of the United States and China. 8 \u00e2\u0080\u009cHigh cost of energy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d BusinessEurope, accessed September 8, 2025. The volatility of supply chains for critical raw materials such as rare earth elements (REEs) threatens the availability of essential inputs for EV motors and electronics, because more than 95 percent of EU REE imports come from China. 9 \u00e2\u0080\u009cCritical raw materials,\u00e2\u0080\u009d European Commission, accessed August 29, 2025. Batteries in particular are now treated as strategic assets, and China controlled over 80 percent of the global battery value chain as of 2023. 10 \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina dominates global trade of battery minerals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d US Energy Information Administration, May 21, 2025. However, movements to localize supply have faced setbacks, with recent bankruptcies seeing nearly half of announced capacity vanish in the short term. Structural and regulatory challenges in the European operating environment. Restructuring and adaptation efforts, such as adjusting operating footprints and labor shifts, are more complex in Europe than in other regions because of a regulatory landscape with rigorous compliance standards and approval timelines. Despite the challenges the region faces, the European automotive industry can seize the moment to regain its global competitive advantage and successfully transition to its next phase through targeted action. An action plan for the European automotive industry We have developed an action plan to address the challenges that the European automotive industry is facing and help accelerate the transition toward a sustainable and competitive future. Central to this vision of a new \u00e2\u0080\u009cERA\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a balanced focus on three critical dimensions: Successful economics. European auto players can enable sustainable profits to secure the auto ecosystem, sustain jobs, and boost Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GDP. Successful resilience. European auto players can build resilient value chains, reduce dependency on other regions, and maintain Europe as a supply chain powerhouse. Successful decarbonization (\u00e2\u0080\u009cabatement of CO 2 \u00e2\u0080\u009d). The European automotive industry can achieve net zero by 2050 through zero-emission powertrains and effective sector coupling. For Europe to achieve a successful transition along each of these dimensions, it will need to address three core pillars: transforming European automotive companies, future-proofing the value chain, and leveling the playing field to compete globally (Exhibit 1). 1. Transforming European automotive companies Adapting for the future requires transformation. European automotive companies will need to continue investing to bring their pipeline of new vehicles to market, boost operational efficiency to cut costs and increase speed, and implement regionalized portfolios to cater to diverging customer requirements. Invest more than \u00e2\u0082\u00ac150 billion annually in the future of automotive The European automotive industry plans to bring about 350 new EV models to market by 2032. Over 70 percent of these are expected to be BEVs, 11 Based on data from S&P Global Light Vehicle Production Forecast and McKinsey Center for Future Mobility. with the rest being various electric hybrids, including plug-in vehicles, range-extended vehicles, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. In recent years, European OEMs and major suppliers have spent nearly \u00e2\u0082\u00ac150 billion annually, 12 Elisabeth Nindl et al., \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe 2024 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d European Commission, December 18, 2024. split roughly equally between R&D and capital investments. This makes the automotive industry by far the biggest driver of innovation in Europe, responsible for about 30 percent of total EU innovation spending. 13 \u00e2\u0080\u009cSectoral R&D shares in the European Union,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ACEA, September 12, 2024.\" Heavy investments in new production facilities and next-generation vehicle technology will continue to be required in coming years, but the sector can sustain this level of investment only if it continues to produce healthy balance sheets. While maintaining current investment levels is critical, directing these resources toward high-impact, differentiating factors (as outlined in following sections) will be essential. Diversifying funding sources could ease this burden: Increased M&A activity and venture capital inflows could unlock new opportunities, while EU-backed low-interest loans for crucial projects may provide additional support. Public\u00e2\u0080\u0093private partnerships could further help fund large-scale initiatives such as battery gigafactories and charging networks. By focusing on both effective resource allocation and innovative funding mechanisms, stakeholders can drive competitive advantages and long-term success. Improve costs by 20 to 50 percent and cut time to market in half Disruptors around the world have gained market share by working radically differently from incumbents, heralding a new industrial horizon. These newcomers outperform on their pace of product development and plant construction and use new manufacturing, battery innovation, integration, and design techniques. With these techniques, these players are putting vehicles on the market at a price point 20 to 50 percent lower compared to European competitors and bringing them to market up to twice as fast, according to McKinsey analysis. Several key levers can help European companies keep pace with disruptors, evolving technologies, and changing customer preferences: Make radical technology changes. Adopting a next-generation \u00e2\u0080\u009cdesign to value\u00e2\u0080\u009d mindset focused on true customer differentiation can enable European automakers to prioritize features and innovations that reinforce brand distinction while shedding unnecessary complexity. Implementing advancements in battery technology, including optimizing form factors for efficiency, and pivoting to low-cost chemistries\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as lithium (with manganese) iron phosphate or sodium-ion technologies\u00e2\u0080\u0094can materially lower vehicle costs and improve supply chains. At the same time, simplifying the structural design through approaches such as cell-to-body integration can reduce part count, streamline assembly, and improve performance. Elevating functional integration\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as by combining multiple electronic controls, adopting bank loading, or deploying centralized domain and zone controllers\u00e2\u0080\u0094minimizes wiring and hardware complexity, further saving costs and accelerating build times. Finally, OEMs and suppliers can thoroughly review and stress-test their requirements, which often originate from legacy ICE business practices (for example, sensor redundancy, load factors, material thickness, and noise, vibration, and harshness requirements). Stakeholders can reassess these requirements, many of which have a limited impact on customer value, safety, and durability, while incurring unnecessary costs. Accelerate product development to decrease time to market. With rapid shifts in both electrification and software, accelerating development has become critical to stay competitive and control costs. Chinese OEMs have proved that time to market can be reduced to less than two years\u00e2\u0080\u0094more than twice as fast as established players. To close the gap with faster-moving global competitors, European automotive players need to fundamentally accelerate innovation and move from traditional sequential engineering to agile, asynchronous development models. By adopting trigger-based development\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which software is iteratively tested and refined, even alongside immature hardware\u00e2\u0080\u0094teams can compress critical paths, particularly for software-heavy components such as battery management, vehicle control, and advanced driving systems. This shift is especially valuable because these systems increasingly define product differentiation and require rapid, continuous iteration. Enhance supply chain efficiency and gain advantage from extensive supplier collaboration and partnerships. European automotive manufacturers can explore new working relationships and processes with suppliers, such as using an \u00e2\u0080\u009copen book\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach in which manufacturers and suppliers collaboratively shape requirements and designs early in the process, allowing for faster time to market. This vertical collaboration often means working side by side with suppliers and partners to quickly iterate and explore new solutions as well as integrating knowledge from the broader ecosystem. These approaches can help players make step changes in performance, cost, and time to market for technical solutions, as well as build localized, diversified, and resilient supply chains. Platform and component sharing among OEMs can also unlock economies of scale in the value chain. European automotive players need to fundamentally accelerate innovation and move from traditional sequential engineering to agile, asynchronous development models. Optimize manufacturing footprints and processes. Manufacturers need to reassess where and how they produce vehicles and components. By optimizing their global footprints for maximum utilization of plants, cost-effective locations, and proximity to key markets, manufacturers can account for costs, fluctuating tariffs, and supply chain risks. Embracing manufacturing-optimized vehicle designs can help simplify process steps, reduce variability, and streamline production. Additionally, adopting advanced techniques such as gigacasting and unboxed or modular manufacturing can boost efficiency, enabling faster execution and cost savings. Embrace AI to unlock additional efficiency. Deployment of AI applications throughout vehicle development, production, and operational and administrative processes could unlock over \u00e2\u0082\u00ac100 billion in total annual value and efficiency gains by 2030 for European OEMs, according to McKinsey analysis. European automotive companies can embrace agentic AI to boost productivity in engineering, sales, and administrative tasks; deploy autonomous robotics to handle a variety of production steps; and streamline processes from logistics to development cycles. Greater economies of scale are essential to ensure these cost and efficiency levers deliver their intended outcomes. Market benchmarks for pure EV players indicate that positive margins through scaling require the production of at least 80,000 EVs per quarter, according to analysis by the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility. However, scale alone is not enough; best-in-class organizational efficiency is also required to unlock operating leverage. Streamlined, digitally enabled organizations with rapid decision-making, rigorous performance management, and lean overheads are better equipped to adapt to shifting markets and regulations\u00e2\u0080\u0094and to translate strategic intent into industry-leading performance and sustained leadership in the global automotive transition. Implement a regional, customer-focused operating model Regional automotive markets are diverging rapidly, propelled by major differences in electrification uptake, technology expectations, and consumer behavior. In China, nearly half of all new cars sold in 2024 were \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew energy vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u009d (NEVs)\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, vehicles mostly or completely powered by electric energy. Within total NEV sales, 28 percent were BEVs and 15 percent were plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). Sales also included a 6 percent share of extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) 14 \u00e2\u0080\u009c What is an EREV? ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, June 23, 2025. \u00e2\u0080\u0094which are often referred to in Europe as range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs)\u00e2\u0080\u0094a long-range hybrid EV almost unique to China that is quickly gaining popularity there. By contrast, in the same year, Europe saw BEV adoption at just 14 percent and PHEV adoption at 7 percent, with the United States trailing at 10 percent combined. 15 Based on data from EV Volumes, S&P Light Vehicle Sales, and McKinsey Center for Future Mobility. China also stands out regarding expected future demand: 45 percent of Chinese consumers responding to a recent survey said they plan to choose a BEV as their next car, compared to only 23 percent in Europe and 12 percent in the United States. An additional 37 percent in China are considering a PHEV or REEV. Notably, only 18 percent of Chinese buyers expect their next car to be an ICE, compared to 49 percent in Europe and 70 percent in the United States. However, if long-range hybrids were widely available, 24 percent of European and 23 percent of US consumers said they would consider buying these\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though nearly all of these customers initially stated they would buy an ICE. 16 \u00e2\u0080\u009c New twists in the electric-vehicle transition: A consumer perspective ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, April 22, 2025. The demand for ADAS highlights an even starker contrast: Over 75 percent of Chinese consumers expressed interest in L2+ ADAS, and more than 65 percent are interested in L3. 17 L2+ and L3 designate levels of maturity for autonomous driving technologies. For more, see \u00e2\u0080\u009c Autonomous driving\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future: Convenient and connected ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, January 6, 2023. This makes ADAS a top ten purchasing criterion in China, with premium buyers ranking ADAS even higher (top four). In Europe, ADAS is much less influential, with only about 40 percent interested in L2+ and about 30 percent in L3. 18 All consumer data in this section is based on McKinsey Center for Future Mobility\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Consumer Pulse Survey 2025. Digital experiences and brand attitudes are also shifting the landscape. In China, smart cockpit features and voice assistants are key priorities, while these remain \u00e2\u0080\u009cnice to have\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than table stakes in the United States and Europe. Chinese consumers show a remarkable openness to new brands, with 82 percent interested in Chinese EV disruptors and over 65 percent open to switching to a new brand for their next purchase, rating better advanced driving and smart-cockpit performance as the most important reasons for preferring a Chinese brand. However, while domestic brand loyalty remains strong in the West, 21 percent of Europeans and 25 percent of Americans said they would consider a new car from a Chinese EV brand. Given these marked regional differences, European automakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 traditional strategy of developing a single vehicle platform for global use is losing viability. They can switch gears by adopting a more localized development strategy, building regional supply chains, and tailoring offerings for distinct markets. 19 For more on the importance of customer centricity in automotive, see RACE 2050 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a vision for the European automotive industry , McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, January 2019. This addresses the unique regulatory, infrastructure, and consumer needs of different regions, as well as mitigating supply chain volatility. However, it also increases complexity and can erode economies of scale, requiring strategic partnerships and alliances for a regionalized system to remain cost competitive. Meeting these diverse requirements calls for region-specific product definitions, differentiated design priorities, and brand evolution. In software-defined vehicles, for example, it may be advantageous to establish dedicated, empowered capabilities within key local markets such as China to address each region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique pace of digital adoption and consumer demands. Cross-functional, data-driven teams with a customer-first mindset are critical to inform product design, pricing strategies, and localized customer engagement based on identified pain points, trends, and regional preferences. Finally, collaboration within local ecosystems will play a pivotal role in successful regionalization. Strategic partnerships with local players can accelerate access to technologies, capabilities, and market insights. Vehicle differentiation developed in regional hubs\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly in innovation-driven markets\u00e2\u0080\u0094can simultaneously satisfy local demand and contribute to global portfolios. In the context of increasing regionalization within the global automotive industry, such partnerships could pave the way for a new era of \u00e2\u0080\u009cregional globalization,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which localized innovation drives both regional success and global competitiveness. Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery industry needs a paradigm change based on a coordinated, strategic approach spanning the entire value chain. 2. Future-proofing the value chain In addition to transforming individual company operations within the European automotive industry, the ecosystem has to be strengthened to future-proof the value chain. This includes developing a competitive EU battery value chain, doubling down on critical future technology, and building partnerships to ensure a resilient supply of critical materials. Develop a competitive EU battery value chain According to McKinsey Battery Insights, Europe accounts for less than 10 percent of global battery cell production capacity\u00e2\u0080\u0094and even less in upstream activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094leaving European OEMs highly dependent on global supply chains (Exhibit 2). In 2030, European EV battery demand is expected to be between 600 and 800 gigawatt-hours (GWh), three to four times the nearly 200 GWh capacity installed as of 2024. Given initial production constraints (for example, ramp-up and yield issues), expected demand could even be four to six times today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity. As of July 2025, about 600 GWh of announced battery production capacity has failed to materialize because of bankruptcies and project scale-downs. Exacerbating the situation, nearly all lost capacity came from European players, while remaining projects are mainly led by Asian companies. Additionally, there is a growing mismatch between the battery chemistries in demand\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which are completely dependent on China\u00e2\u0080\u0094and current production plans, which remain focused mainly on lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC). Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery industry needs a paradigm change based on a coordinated, strategic approach spanning the entire value chain. Achieving regional competitiveness will require targeted investment of about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac200 billion to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac300 billion by 2035, according to McKinsey analysis, as well as ensuring the required offtake becomes sufficiently attractive. This investment, especially when providing below-market financing mechanisms, could help compensate for regional cost differences to make Europe a compelling battery manufacturing destination for OEMs, suppliers, battery manufacturers, start-ups, and capital markets. In addition, faster approvals, particularly for critical mineral and material refining, along with measures to attract and retain talent, can play a key role in fostering this change. Getting this project off the ground will require concerted European-level effort\u00e2\u0080\u0094not local initiatives by individual countries and players. Not all parts of the battery production chain need to be completely localized in Europe, but strategic control in critical areas could help ensure resilience against supply shocks. A higher share of localized processing across cell manufacturing and upstream activities could also significantly increase value within Europe. Providing incentives for supply chain participation, unlocking R&D capabilities, and facilitating skills transfers are all essential to strengthening these steps of the battery manufacturing chain within Europe. Offering joint ventures and attractive opportunities could draw in leading foreign players, with an emphasis on fostering technology-sharing partnerships, deep integration of world-class expertise, and accelerating technology localization. Public and private investment can work together to create incentives for such knowledge transfer and collaborative innovation. Only through a coordinated, partnership-driven approach can Europe establish a robust, competitive battery value chain and secure a resilient EV transition. Double down on critical future technology It is also vital to advance other key automotive technology fields, as McKinsey explored in the article \u00e2\u0080\u009cEuropean automotive industry: What it takes to regain competitiveness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d 20 \u00e2\u0080\u009c European automotive industry: What it takes to regain competitiveness ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, March 10, 2025. Strategic activities such as in-house R&D investments, M&A, and partnerships could help Europe scale production and catch up or expand its leadership. Seven technology domains are emerging as particularly critical to prioritize: 1. Software-defined vehicles (SDVs). Software is becoming a key differentiating factor for vehicles and automotive business models. Despite stagnating global vehicle sales, vehicle life cycle revenues are expected to grow by about 30 percent until 2035. 21 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, October 3, 2024. Much of this growth is expected to be propelled, either directly or indirectly, by software-enabled functions, creating major opportunities to differentiate through software ecosystems. In new OEMs outside Europe, more than 40 percent of R&D employees specialize in software, compared with only about 15 percent at incumbent European OEMs. 22 \u00e2\u0080\u009c European automotive industry: What it takes to regain competitiveness ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, March 10, 2025. To remain competitive, European players can address the growing importance of software by building centralized electrical and electronic (E/E) architectures and scalable, cloud-native software platforms. A potential key enabler of this transformation is the development of a common, open-source middleware stack for foundational software layers. Such a stack could reduce complexity, lower costs, and accelerate innovation by providing a shared foundation for non-differentiating functions. While projects are already underway in this space, further collaboration among OEMs, tier-one suppliers, and tech players could unlock its full potential. However, views on this approach differ. While a common middleware stack offers significant benefits, the ability to differentiate and maintain competitiveness remains essential. Companies must ensure that using a shared foundation enables them to focus their resources on developing proprietary, value-adding software features and ecosystems on top of it. Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to attract and retain top software talent will also be a decisive factor in closing the gap with global competitors, highlighting the need to foster partnerships with universities and create attractive career paths for software engineers. By addressing these challenges, European players can accelerate product development, expand software-related innovation, and secure a competitive edge in the global market. 2. ADAS and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subdued demand for advanced driving technology risks industry complacency and declining investment, potentially placing OEMs and suppliers at a disadvantage. EU players are facing issues including ecosystem fragmentation, system complexity, and high development costs. As with SDVs, European players can collaborate to create shared, open-source base stacks for key ADAS layers, enabling companies to develop differentiating functionality on top. Joint investment in AI training infrastructure, potentially with government support, can further strengthen this ecosystem. These steps could help lower overall costs, accelerate development, and reduce the risk of falling behind and losing market share. As for autonomous vehicles, Europe lacks a robust L4 technology base, with few active players and low levels of funding. 23 L4 refers to the level of maturity of autonomous vehicles as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). L4 vehicles can self-drive in specific areas, such as cities, but humans have the option to manually override them. Governments would need to commit significant resources\u00e2\u0080\u0094McKinsey estimates over \u00e2\u0082\u00ac200 million per test zone is required\u00e2\u0080\u0094for a handful of locations across Europe to serve as test beds for shared autonomous fleets, targeting full-scale deployments by 2027\u00e2\u0080\u009328. However, to avoid funding vehicles for large test fleets without achieving commercialization\u00e2\u0080\u0094and to avoid the pitfalls of many small-scale R&D projects\u00e2\u0080\u0094funding should be tied to real-world deployment (for example, by cofinancing every commercial mile driven), ensuring that investments directly support scaling AV mobility services. This funding can be structured as a co-investment, with the majority of the required capital coming from AV mobility players. Creating an attractive environment for companies to launch AV mobility services in Europe will also be critical. This includes introducing an enabling regulatory framework, building supporting infrastructure, and accelerating type approval and licensing processes. Unified AD standards and streamlined compliance across the European Union will help cut adaptation costs and speed up market entry. Players can further accelerate progress by collaborating in test zones, developing common software layers, and attracting top software talent while fostering closer ties with universities. 3. Semiconductors. Semiconductors are critical to advancing in software-defined vehicles and automotive AI because they deliver the processing power required for advanced functions in vehicles and in cloud or edge environments. 24 For more, see \u00e2\u0080\u009c The rise of edge AI in automotive ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, August 25, 2025. Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automotive industry urgently needs to shore up its semiconductor ecosystem; demand for automotive semiconductors in Europe is expected to rise about 25 percent toward 2030, according to the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, and global expansion is accelerating, particularly in Asia and the United States. Europe is home to only about 10 percent of global front-end capacity and about 1 percent of back-end capacity, putting the region at risk of increased dependence on global supply chains. 25 \u00e2\u0080\u009c European automotive industry: What it takes to regain competitiveness ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, March 10, 2025. See also Semiconductor crisis, VDA (German Association of the Automotive Industry), 2023. To counter this, Europe can target strategic investments in design and front- and back-end capacity, tackle structural cost barriers, and leverage its strengths in early-stage R&D, equipment, and industrial and power electronics. Anchoring efforts on industry leaders, fostering collaboration between OEMs and the semiconductor industry, expanding software expertise (potentially through industry-driven semiconductor skills programs to attract, develop, and retain world-class talent), and better integrating start-ups and universities will be essential to secure robust supply chains and protect Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technological edge. 4. E-powertrains. The market for electric powertrains (excluding their batteries) is currently highly fragmented, with over 50 suppliers for eDrive components alone, according to McKinsey analysis. Most of these suppliers are failing to profit because of high costs driven by extensively customized designs (despite limited actual differentiation) and complex tier-N value chains. Collaborations, industry-wide platforms, and certain standardized requirements could significantly reduce costs. At the same time, targeted innovations\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as advancements in power semiconductors and higher levels of functional integration\u00e2\u0080\u0094could further enhance efficiency. While OEMs and suppliers may be able to boost competitiveness by shifting select development activities such as power electronics to lower-cost regions in Asia, it is important to balance this with strategies that prevent overdependence on any single region and safeguard critical technological capabilities. 5. ICE components. Efficient internal combustion engines and hybrid powertrains are expected to remain in operation for decades in Europe (considering aftermarket), and even longer in markets outside of Europe, resulting in a market still worth \u00e2\u0082\u00ac100 billion by 2035, according to the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility. The region can leverage its long-standing leadership in this technology to provide a stable industrial cash flow in the coming years. Effectively managing this gradual phaseout is critical. Establishing a hub for ICE expertise and operations, consolidating efforts with other players, and optimizing plant utilization through resource pooling and operational alignment can significantly enhance efficiency. These measures will not only support the industry during the transition but also enable a smoother shift toward low-emission powertrains as global demand for ICE technology steadily declines. 6. Alternative fuels. Europe is well positioned to lead the transition to hydrogen technology and sustainable fuels, leveraging its strong legacy of innovation in efficient combustion technology and industrial processes. By scaling up solutions such as renewable diesel, biogasoline, and e-gasoline, Europe could potentially phase out fossil fuels entirely by 2050. This transition is particularly important for areas that are harder to electrify, including the existing vehicle parc, shipping, and aviation. Sustainable fuels offer an additional opportunity for collaboration between sectors, providing relevance for material decarbonization, industrial production, and low-emission vehicle usage, though the long-term sustainability of sustainable fuels and their role in road transport remain subject to debate. A large share of biofuels currently comes from Asia. This creates some regional dependence in Europe, but it also contributes to a broader and more geographically diverse set of supply options (alongside fossil fuels and battery minerals from other regions), thus supporting resilience through supply spread. While these fuels are more expensive than fossil fuels, strong demand mandates and regulatory support could unlock significant volumes, leaving end users with a choice of decarbonization pathways while providing incentives toward electrification over time. A factor to consider is that production capacity and value chain maturity vary by fuel type. While bio- and e-gasoline supply chains remain underdeveloped, other fuels, such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), benefit from mature supply chains and even temporary overcapacity. With clear demand signals, Europe can take a leading role in advancing zero- and low-emission fuels as part of a broader portfolio of solutions. 7. Circularity and secondary materials. Strengthening closed-loop systems could contribute to Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sustainability and competitiveness aims, reducing supply risks and costs. Circularity will be critical for battery materials, given the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reliance on primary and refined resources from China. By 2040, half of European battery demand could be met by recycled materials. 26 For more, see \u00e2\u0080\u009c Powering the energy transition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motor: Circular rare earth elements ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, July 24, 2025. Europe could be very competitive in this area, but it must act swiftly to establish a global presence by the early 2030s, when, according to McKinsey analysis, the availability of end-of-life batteries is expected to start to surge. To fully electrify Europe, the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DC charging network must be significantly extended to cover all EU member states. Build partnerships for a resilient supply of critical materials Of the 34 critical and strategic raw materials the European Union has designated fundamental for security and sustainability, 27 \u00e2\u0080\u009cCritical raw materials,\u00e2\u0080\u009d European Commission, accessed August 29, 2025. about 25 are relevant to the automotive sector and 14 are essential. Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply chains for EV production are particularly exposed, with needs ranging from lithium and graphite for batteries to a fourfold increase in REEs, primarily for the permanent magnets needed for electromotors. Although China holds less than 10 percent of the global reserves for most battery materials\u00e2\u0080\u0094apart from graphite\u00e2\u0080\u0094it controls, on average, over 40 percent of global mining operations across battery materials and more than 80 percent of refining capacity, according to analysis by McKinsey MineSpans. Critically, more than 95 percent of the European Union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s REE volume originates from China, with only limited final processing taking place within the European Union. 28 \u00e2\u0080\u009cCritical raw materials,\u00e2\u0080\u009d European Commission, accessed August 29, 2025. This leaves Europe highly exposed to potential supply disruptions. Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security requires careful consideration of the strategic and geopolitical implications of these dependencies. Strengthening supply chain resilience for these critical materials is vital\u00e2\u0080\u0094not only to ease margin pressure for OEMs and suppliers but also to bolster regional independence. What could make a difference are strategic resource partnerships with countries rich in these materials, ensuring a sustainable approach to resource extraction. At the same time, industrial alliances can help secure critical areas of the supply chain for key technologies such as batteries and semiconductors. Enhancing local refining capacity, potentially through international collaboration, would reduce reliance on external processing and could be supported by streamlined permitting, incentives, and innovation to ensure scalability and sustainability. Additionally, building strategic stockpiles of materials such as rare earths, cobalt, and nickel could provide a buffer against future disruptions. 3. Leveling the playing field To create the right boundary conditions to level the playing field with other regions, European stakeholders must accelerate infrastructure, grid, and renewable energy rollout; enable flexibility in the shift to zero emissions; and close competitiveness gaps. Accelerate infrastructure, grid, and renewable energy rollout While certain countries are powering ahead with charging-infrastructure rollout, other regions are still considerably lacking. To fully electrify Europe, the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DC charging network must be significantly extended to cover all EU member states. By 2035, charging infrastructure would need to grow about sixfold to ensure a ratio of about one charger for every 15 EVs, with variation between regions and based on charging capacity. McKinsey estimates about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac350 billion needs to be invested in the charging network to meet electrification goals. These investments, including in adjacent technologies such as power grids and renewable-energy generation to supply green electricity to those charge points, would be required to support a ramp-up to 100 percent zero-emission vehicle sales in 2035. Well-established public charging networks underpinned by cost-efficient clean-energy production could reduce range anxiety and lower fast-charging costs, helping consumers embrace EVs and building a sustainable mobility ecosystem. Several actions could accelerate infrastructure rollout. Streamlining permitting across the European Union could reduce delays in EV infrastructure and renewable-energy projects. Cross-industry collaboration with grid operators and renewable-energy generators could help players innovate, standardize charging infrastructure to ensure its interoperability, and synchronize grid upgrades with the rollout of charging infrastructure. Public\u00e2\u0080\u0093private partnerships could also increase funding efficiency. As this infrastructure is rolled out, average use rates will likely be below targets because supply will have to be built out ahead of demand. For 100 percent of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2035, a widespread charging-infrastructure network will be essential. However, McKinsey Center for Future Mobility simulations show that about 25 percent of vehicles on the road are expected to be electric by then, meaning some regional networks can expect prolonged lower utilization. Public funding will thus be crucial to support network build-out in certain geographies and use cases. In the meantime, EV adoption is expected to happen faster in higher-density areas. Navigate challenges on the road to net zero Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambitious decarbonization goals include transitioning to zero-emission vehicles by 2035. Achieving this target will require the region to address several challenges (Exhibit 3). For instance, Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery industry and EV ecosystem face specific challenges in scaling up to fully support a complete transition to BEVs. Consumer demand also remains uneven, with only about 20 percent of consumers in Europe considering a BEV for their next purchase, while over 40 percent are leaning toward long-range hybrids and another 40 percent toward ICE vehicles. 29 \u00e2\u0080\u009c New twists in the electric-vehicle transition: A consumer perspective ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, April 22, 2025. One factor in this may be that EVs often cost 20 to 30 percent more than comparable ICE vehicles (excluding subsidies), according to McKinsey Center for Future Mobility analysis. This makes affordability, along with range, a primary concern among consumers. In addition, European electricity prices are high; the operating cost advantage of driving EVs compared to ICE vehicles has been a key factor behind EV adoption in China. 30 Nic Lutsey, Hongyang Cui, and Rujie Yu, Evaluating electric vehicle costs and benefits in China in the 2020\u00e2\u0080\u00932035 time frame , International Council on Clean Transportation, 2021. If these trends persist, some consumers may delay the transition to EVs\u00e2\u0080\u0094either due to affordability issues or because EVs do not meet their needs. This is especially true for buyers of smaller cars and light commercial vehicles, as well as for those in regions with insufficient charging infrastructure. Such a scenario could slow progress in decarbonization efforts as higher-emission vehicles remain on the roads for longer; the average vehicle in Europe is nearly 13 years old, up from less than ten a decade ago. 31 The automobile industry pocket guide 2024/2025 , Acea, September 2024; The automobile industry pocket guide 2015/2016 , Acea, June 2015 Other effects may include a surge in last-minute ICE purchases before 2035 and a potential drop in vehicle purchases after 2035, challenging the economics of OEMs and suppliers. To mitigate these risks, the EV ecosystem\u00e2\u0080\u0094in particular, charging infrastructure and the European battery value chain, including access to battery raw materials\u00e2\u0080\u0094needs to scale rapidly, supported by cost reductions on EVs. For example, deployment of charging infrastructure will need to accelerate by a factor of two to three, according to McKinsey analysis. The industry could also explore solutions that have worked well elsewhere. For example, long-range hybrid electric vehicles, including PHEVs and REEVs, are gaining traction in some markets, accounting for about half of EV sales in China. Many of these hybrids now offer sufficient electric range for daily activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094around 100 kilometers for average PHEVs and over 200 kilometers for some Chinese REEV models. 32 Based on data from EV Volumes, S&P Light Vehicle Sales, and McKinsey Center for Future Mobility. As a result, they can provide more affordable electric driving most of the time while alleviating range anxiety for consumers by providing the fallback option of a combustion engine (which could eventually become powered by sustainable fuels). In regions with limited charging infrastructure, such vehicles could complement the broader adoption of BEVs by addressing consumer concerns and supporting regulatory goals for low-emission vehicles. Additionally, the smaller batteries in these hybrids could reduce demand for scarce materials and ease pressure on the European battery supply chain. Emissions could potentially be further reduced through broader decarbonization strategies across the vehicle life cycle. Measures could include replacing older vehicles earlier, increasing the use of sustainable fuels, and providing incentives to use green electricity for charging. Further reductions from a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbusiness as usual\u00e2\u0080\u009d scenario could be possible by increasing the use of low-carbon materials such as green steel and aluminum and manufacturing with renewable energy. This could not only reduce Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passenger-vehicle emissions footprint but also accelerate development of local, low-carbon industrial production across Europe. However, none of these measures can be implemented as last-minute solutions, as other regions have shown. Developing these value chains in Europe will require adequate incentives, long-term planning, and cross-industry collaboration to ensure the necessary scaling and investment. Close the gaps As Europe seeks to close the competitiveness gap\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially in comparison to the United States and China\u00e2\u0080\u0094it will need to address high labor costs and skills shortages, high energy prices and supply chain vulnerability, low productivity, underinvestment in growth, a complex regulatory landscape with long lead times, and lack of scale due to fragmentation. 33 Mario Draghi, The Draghi report: A competitiveness strategy for Europe , September 9, 2024. Substantial, coordinated investments will be essential. Overcoming chronic underinvestment and ensuring rapid scaling will require deep, integrated capital markets and targeted public\u00e2\u0080\u0093private co-investment, especially for new technologies. Improving access to low-interest financing for manufacturers and innovators will help Europe attract risk capital, support industrial champions, and drive long-term growth across the sector. Investment is required to accelerate renewable-energy deployment and grid integration to provide Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automotive hubs with access to stable, low-cost green electricity. Equally important is ensuring robust digital connectivity and data infrastructure, which underpin both advanced manufacturing and the rollout of AI-driven and autonomous vehicle technologies. Furthermore, Europe can invest in upskilling its automotive workforce and in ensuring that advanced digital and AI technologies are thoughtfully integrated into factories to boost productivity. Talent mobility programs such as expedited visas, housing assistance, and comprehensive reskilling could also help retain and attract needed expertise. Overall, a unified approach is essential for Europe to close the competitiveness gap. Working together, European countries could explore a number of potential avenues, such as incentive scheme frameworks at the EU and national levels and demand-side actions such as reinstating local EV subsidies (including for secondhand vehicles) or fleet renewal programs to stimulate domestic demand and speed up the replacement of older ICE vehicles. Drawing lessons from San Francisco and Shenzhen, Europe could accelerate its innovation cycle by creating dedicated innovation zones with streamlined administrative processes, integrated R&D funding, early-stage capital access, and public\u00e2\u0080\u0093private partnerships among industry, government, and academia. Finally, for Europe to truly compete globally, it can harness the full diversity of its strengths across regions, deploying low-cost labor in some areas, affordable green energy in others, and access to critical minerals or advanced industrial hubs elsewhere. By strategically leveraging these complementary assets collaboratively (rather than each country acting alone), Europe can build integrated automotive value chains with greater efficiency, scale, and innovation. As Europe works to strengthen its long-term competitiveness, it will need a level playing field, especially during today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s period of transition. As the sector evolves, industry stakeholders should stay abreast of international pricing practices and regional differences in labor, energy, and standards. Thoughtful and effective safeguards in these areas can help maintain resilience in the automotive sector as longer-term investments take hold and support healthy competition. Reestablishing Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading position in the global automotive industry, future-proofing the value chain, and leveling the playing field demand immediate, full-scale, and coordinated efforts. The stakes could not be higher: Without radical and decisive action now, the risk of a severe economic downturn for the automotive sector\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the broader region\u00e2\u0080\u0094is immense. Companies must act urgently to undergo rapid and fundamental transformations by embracing new technologies, improving productivity, and adapting to shifting market dynamics. At the same time, the public sector must create the conditions for these transformations to succeed\u00e2\u0080\u0094through streamlined regulations, targeted incentives, and investments in critical infrastructure such as renewable energy, digital connectivity, and supply chain resilience. The time for incremental change has passed. Only bold, synchronized action between industry players and the public sector can revamp Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manufacturing sector, safeguard its competitiveness, and secure long-term prosperity for the industry and the region. The moment to act is now.

  "extracted_text": "European automotive industry: What it takes to regain competitiveness | McKinsey Skip to main content European automotive industry: What it takes to regain competitiveness March 10, 2025 | Article Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automotive industry has been a cornerstone of the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy, but disruptions have challenged its leadership. How can the European industry restore its competitive edge? (15 pages) The automotive industry \u00e2\u0080\u0094including OEMs of passenger cars and trucks, suppliers, and downstream players such as aftermarket or financing providers\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a major part of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy. These players collectively account for 7 percent of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GDP, providing about 13.8 million direct and indirect jobs. 1 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutomotive industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d European Commission, accessed December 13, 2024. In 2019, the European Union dominated the global automotive market, hosting ten of the top 20 suppliers and four of the top ten OEMs by revenue. Yet this leadership position has been challenged by disruptive changes in powertrain technology, consumer demands for specialized features within vehicles, and the shift from hardware- to software-defined vehicles . 2 \u00e2\u0080\u009c How European consumers perceive electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, August 5, 2024. Enhancing the industry's competitiveness requires substantial additional investments to facilitate the transition to electrified powertrains and ensure a reliable supply of critical components. And achieving these objectives will require a collaborative effort from all stakeholders across the automotive industry, adjacent sectors, and the public sector. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Harald Deubener , Lukas Michor , Niels Patschke, and Ruth Heuss , with Franziska Wiebke, Greta Brockmeier, Nicholas Schwarz, and Patrick Wetzel, representing views from McKinsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Automotive & Assembly Practice. This article expands upon other McKinsey research on European automotive suppliers and OEMs. It seeks to discover how these companies are affected by changing industry dynamics, the methods they have found to persevere, and the gaps where further action is essential to regain competitiveness. A core pillar of the European economy at risk Historically, the relevance of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automotive industry expands far beyond its core in terms of spillover effects: every euro invested in the automotive industry results in 2.6 times the value added for the wider economy. The industry contributes more than ten million jobs indirectly to downstream and adjacent industries. 3 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutomotive industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d European Commission, accessed December 13, 2024. Projects for the automotive industry make up 10 percent of the gross value added for both manufacturers of basic metals, rubber, and plastic products and manufacturers of fabricated metal products. 4 2023 EU industrial R&D investment scoreboard , European Commission, 2023. European automotive OEMs also make up 40 percent of European semiconductor demand across EMEA, 5 Based on McKinsey analysis of Omdia data from the second quarter of 2024. and the automotive industry accounts for 75 percent of European battery sales. 6 S&P Global data; McKinsey Battery Insights; McKinsey Center for Future Mobility data. Moreover, in 2023, the European automotive industry contributed around \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.7 trillion in gross value added to the European economy, with technology and car exports generating about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac570 billion . 7 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, October 3, 2024. And by 2030, 30 percent of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s green steel demand is projected to be attributable to the automotive industry. 8 McKinsey MineSpans. About the methodology In June and July of 2024, McKinsey conducted a study about the automotive industry in Europe. For this analysis, we interviewed 50 leading industry experts and surveyed about 50 automotive OEMs and suppliers that are members of the European Automobile Manufacturers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Association (ACEA) and the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA). Additional insights were derived from the 2024 Mobility Consumer Survey from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM) and the Supplier Pulse Check Survey conducted in October 2024 by McKinsey and CLEPA among 119 suppliers. Compared to historic heights, the competitiveness of the European automotive industry has decreased. Since 2017, European automakers have lost more than 13 percentage points in market share , 9 S&P Global data for EV sales volumes; McKinsey analysis from Andreas Cornet, Ruth Heuss, Patrick Schaufuss, and Andreas Tschiesner, \u00e2\u0080\u009c A road map for Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automotive industry ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, August 31, 2023. while the average profitability of European automotive suppliers has dropped from 7.4 percent in 2017 to 5.1 percent in 2023. 10 Automotive suppliers are based on a proprietary McKinsey database, and regional allocation is based on headquarters in EMEA due to the differing reporting practices across companies and overall data availability. In a recent survey with 119 automotive suppliers, 66 percent expect that the state of low profitability will continue at least until 2025. 11 McKinsey and CLEPA Pulse Check Survey, October 2024. This decreased profitability also feeds a further challenge: companies may struggle to gather the funds needed to advance the automotive transformation\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially smaller companies with limited access to external means such as debt financing. Further, recent McKinsey analysis estimates that about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac370 billion in gross value added \u00c2 (nearly 21 percent of total automotive value added in Europe) is at risk amid the shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) (see sidebar \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout the methodology\u00e2\u0080\u009d). 12 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, October 3, 2024. For Europe to regain its competitiveness, stakeholders across the value chain must address prevailing disruptions and deploy strategies that allow them to work collaboratively to achieve the same goal. Five disruptions cause unparalleled need for change The European automotive industry is increasingly under pressure. Five disruptions require the industry to significantly adapt to regain competitiveness. Geoeconomics. Currently, 64 percent of all motor vehicles produced by the European automotive industry are exported to countries outside the European Union, and 43 percent of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value added originates from vehicle sales to non-European countries. 13 2023 EU industrial R&D investment scoreboard , European Commission, 2023. Yet recent disruptive events have put significant pressure on local supply chains and have strained customer access. While Chinese OEMs challenge US and European OEMs in their home markets, the United States has increased tariffs for Chinese EVs to 100 percent. 14 \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Biden takes action to protect American workers and businesses from China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfair trade practices,\u00e2\u0080\u009d White House, May 14, 2024. The European Union followed by increasing tariffs by up to 45 percent. 15 \u00e2\u0080\u009cEU greenlights tariffs for Chinese electric vehicles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Deutsche Welle, October 4, 2024. The United States has further expanded tariffs to parts of the automotive supply chain, including semiconductors and batteries. Additional geoeconomic actions between the United States and China, such as export restrictions for chipmaking tools, 16 \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina to restrict exports of chipmaking materials as US mulls new curbs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reuters, July 3, 2023. could lead to a stronger fragmentation of trade flows, increasing product and production costs. These developments could encourage some parts of EV manufacturing and production to move to Europe and help European OEMs close the competitive gap with other countries. For example, several new Chinese OEMs have announced a search for a European production location. 17 \u00e2\u0080\u009cXpeng: We are coming to Europe to bring technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reuters, October 2, 2024; Nick Carey, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BYD will consider second Europe plant in 2025, executive says,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reuters, May 9, 2024. Rising uncertainty in powertrain technology. Despite the recent slowdown in EV adoption rates, global EV sales continue to grow. The McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM) projects that by 2030, 30 to 42 percent of new passenger vehicles sold globally will be battery electric vehicles (BEVs). BEV powertrains are less complex to manufacture than internal-combustion-engine (ICE) vehicles, which has implications for value added in Europe. According to a recent McKinsey study, 85 to 90 percent of the value added from ICE vehicles produced in Europe remains in Europe , whereas only 50 to 60 percent of BEVs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 value added remains in Europe. 18 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, October 3, 2024. There is additional value that can be found in investing in new components. For example, batteries in BEVs account for more than a third of the vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 total value added, and they are currently predominantly manufactured outside of Europe. 19 MCFM data. Tapping into these sources of value would require players to rapidly build up capabilities and supply chains for EVs, actively manage manufacturing setups, address workforce challenges, and reskill employees. For the trucking segment, multiple low-emission technologies are expected to coexist, requiring the automotive industry to account for diverging charging and refueling needs across applications and regions. The MCFM projects that annual sales of heavy-duty vehicles in 2035 can be broken down into the following categories: BEVs, used mainly for short-and midrange distances (approximately 45 percent); fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV), used mainly for long-haul routes (approximately 16 percent); hydrogen ICEs (H2ICE) (approximately 9 percent); and diesel vehicles (approximately 30 percent). Customers and infotainment demand. A smooth digital customer experience has become a nonnegotiable feature for many customers. According to the 2024 MCFM Mobility Consumer Survey, 59 percent of EV buyers and 48 percent of traditional-car buyers believe that their usage of in-car connectivity solutions will increase in the future, and more than 50 percent of both EV and traditional-car buyers will only purchase a car if it comes with automatic smartphone integration, either for free or configurable for a fee. Premium-car buyers increasingly look for a seamless interaction with their vehicle, coupled with a personalized, intuitive user experience and design. To keep up with these customer demands, incumbent players need to rapidly increase the speed of in-house innovations in new technologies, such as voice and hand gesture recognition technologies, or acquire the necessary technology from third parties and effectively integrate those features into their vehicles. Software and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). The global market for automotive software and ADAS features is expected to be worth approximately \u00e2\u0082\u00ac165 billion by 2035. 20 MCFM data. Across regions, OEMs have incorporated ADAS features into their vehicles, including high-definition mapping, positioning systems, and sign identification. Autonomous-driving features will likely become must-haves for consumers everywhere\u00e2\u0080\u0094but particularly in the Chinese market. 21 MCFM Mobility Consumer Survey 2024. The MCFM Mobility Consumer Survey 2024 found that 53 percent of Chinese customers would be willing to switch car brands for better ADAS features. 22 MCFM Mobility Consumer Survey 2024. Chinese growth challenge. Passenger vehicle demand in Europe and the United States has declined by 2.5 percent from 2023 to 2024. 23 Based on McKinsey and Oxford Economics analysis. Purchasing power is largely expected to remain flat in these regions until 2030. In contrast, China is expected to see the income groups that would buy a passenger vehicle grow by 104 percent between 2023 and 2035, 24 Households in the more than \u00e2\u0082\u00ac32,000 annual income bracket are considered relevant for light vehicle demand. and vehicle demand is projected to grow by approximately 2 percent annually. 25 \u00e2\u0080\u009cLight vehicle production forecasts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d S&P Global, accessed December 13, 2024. While European OEMs have historically made large profits in the Chinese market, they are facing increasing competition from domestic Chinese brands. At the same time, the number of OEMs globally is increasing: there are 18 more OEMs and 50 more automotive brands today than there were in 2018. 26 McKinsey analysis of S&P Global data. While the market share of European OEMs has decreased by five percentage points from 2020 to 2023, Chinese OEMs could gain an 18-percentage-point market share in their home market in the same period. 27 McKinsey analysis of S&P Global data. At the same time, Chinese OEMs are entering the European market with ambitious market share targets. 28 For example, see Luca Ciferri and Burkard Riering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBYD executive outlines ambitious plans for Europe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Automotive News China, March 12, 2024. To regain competitiveness, selected European OEMs have entered partnerships to obtain access to advanced software and hardware capabilities. For example, in 2023, a premium European OEM announced a partnership with a Chinese OEM to help boost its BEV offerings. 29 Linda Lew, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAudi, SAIC EV tie-up a \u00e2\u0080\u0098coming of age\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for Chinese automaking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d July 21, 2023. However, results from the recent McKinsey and CLEPA Pulse Check Survey also show that European suppliers have become more hesitant to invest in China, with only 11 percent of survey respondents considering China a key priority region for future growth. 30 McKinsey and CLEPA Pulse Check Survey, October 2024. How the industry can move forward Key insights from McKinsey survey with ACEA and CLEPA member companies The 2024 survey questions among 46 ACEA and CLEPA member companies addressed the status quo of the industry, current trends and challenges, and future opportunities for the European automotive industry. Five key insights emerged: Fifty-nine percent of respondents identified a centralized electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture as a key source of strategic differentiation for cost savings by 2035. For the future competitiveness of the European automotive industry, survey respondents identified a set of non-funding-related requirements, including the setup of a European automotive hub for scaling university research to industrialization (16 percent), a joint open-source software ecosystem (16 percent), and a European semiconductor ecosystem (15 percent) (exhibit). In response to current skill gaps, OEMs and suppliers consider on-the-job training (29 percent) and qualification programs with educational partners such as universities (24 percent) as the most promising solutions. Eighty-one percent of survey respondents believe that the development of energy-efficient components to save energy and increase electric-vehicle range could potentially be a unique selling proposition for the European industry. While 57 percent of respondents consider circularity capabilities as a potential source of profit pools, green materials are considered a cost driver (up to 68 percent of respondents). Image description: A series of horizontal bar charts shows the top seven non-funding-related elements that survey respondents consider most necessary to enable the European auto industry to remain competitive. The top-ranked elements are a European automotive innovation hub; an open-source software ecosystem; a European semiconductor ecosystem; software-defined vehicles based on centralized, cross-domain electrical/electronic architectures; enhanced data-sharing ability across firms; a European battery ecosystem; and restricted on-the-road ADAS testing areas. Each of these elements, save the ADAS testing areas, would require the setup of a European ecosystem for developing and industrializing future core technologies. End image description. In light of these disruptive challenges, how can the European automotive industry reclaim its competitive position? McKinsey sought to discover how the automotive landscape and adjacent markets will evolve through 2035, using its database, surveys from relevant industry groups, and information pulled from interviews with leading industry experts, OEMs, and suppliers (see sidebar \u00e2\u0080\u009cKey insights from McKinsey survey with ACEA and CLEPA member companies\u00e2\u0080\u009d). This research provides seven recommendations for stakeholders across the European automotive industry to regain a competitive edge. OEM-specific recommendations Three recommendations are most relevant for OEMs in the European automotive industry. Embed customer centricity into the core of the business. The MCFM Mobility Consumer Survey 2024 found significant differences in customer preferences across regional markets, particularly in terms of customer experience, connectivity offerings, and autonomous-driving features. 31 MCFM Mobility Consumer Survey 2024. European OEMs must account for this heterogeneity by localizing product and service offerings to address regional market nuances, rather than relying solely on a global one-size-fits-all approach. OEMs can also revise previous global platform strategies to allow for a higher degree of regional customization. 32 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAudi, partner SAIC to develop China-specific EV platform,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reuters, May 20, 2024; \u00e2\u0080\u009cReady for next EV push: Volkswagen enters into agreement with XPENG for fast joint development of two smart e-cars,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Volkswagen Group, February 29, 2024. Recent research by McKinsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Industrials & Electronics Practice has also shown how integrating customer centricity into internal processes can spur growth. 33 Ali Sankur, Ewan Duncan, Gianmarco Cilento, and Steffen Fuchs, \u00e2\u0080\u009c True customer-centricity: An operating model for competitive advantage ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, December 10, 2024. Establish robust regional operating models. Geopolitical constraints and variations in macroeconomic trajectories and regional volume demand necessitate tailored approaches for regional markets. OEMs can assign dedicated leadership to, and create resources for, key markets\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as China, the United States, and the European Union\u00e2\u0080\u0094to better align with local consumer demands and regulatory requirements. In contrast, operating models based on centralized control can result in delayed decision-making and inflexible approaches that fail to resonate with local markets. Develop a competitive strategy for lithium iron phosphate batteries. It is imperative for European OEMs to secure regional capabilities in battery technology and close the supply gap in Europe. Forty-five percent of respondents to the CLEPA and ACEA member survey consider battery performance (referring to range and charging speed, for example) as an important source of strategic differentiation in 2035. A competitive battery strategy will help reduce dependence on foreign partners, contributing to a higher degree of strategic autonomy and preserving export opportunities (to the US market, for instance). Europe has launched actions to increase battery production capacity through the industrial development program of the European Battery Alliance (EBA250), 34 For more, see the website of the European Battery Alliance. but delays and cancellations of builds for European battery gigafactories have slowed progress and suggest a need for individual action by OEMs. Supplier-specific recommendations Results from the most recent McKinsey and CLEPA Pulse Check Survey of 119 European automotive suppliers reveal a rather pessimistic volume outlook for the near future\u00e2\u0080\u009460 percent of survey respondents expect the market to shrink by the end of 2025. 35 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrim outlook for European automotive suppliers, as lower volumes suppress profitability,\u00e2\u0080\u009d CLEPA, November 27, 2024. Considering declining production volumes, European suppliers must find ways to lower their break-even point and mitigate volume volatility by optimizing the ratios of fixed and variable cost. This will require them to adopt a lean operating model with a flexible cost structure, variability in product offerings, and a resilient supply chain. While suppliers should address this challenge holistically, exemplary actions might include optimizing products technically (such as simplifying vehicle architecture or using lean specifications), increasing the use of efficiency-enhancing technologies such as generative AI, or making the structural cost base more flexible. Overall recommendations for both OEMs and suppliers OEMs and suppliers in the European automotive industry can work together in three ways. Accelerate product development cycles. Improving the speed of product development is required to meet rapidly changing customer demands. McKinsey analysis shows that European incumbents lag behind their global counterparts in time to market. 36 Andreas Cornet, Ruth Heuss, Patrick Schaufuss, and Andreas Tschiesner, \u00e2\u0080\u009c A road map for Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automotive industry ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, August 31, 2023. For example, while concept-to-pilot phases last up to four years for European OEMs, benchmark OEMs in China can achieve this milestone in just 21 months, 37 Andreas Cornet, Ruth Heuss, Patrick Schaufuss, and Andreas Tschiesner, \u00e2\u0080\u009c A road map for Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automotive industry ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, August 31, 2023. giving them a first-mover advantage in addressing emerging customer demands. European incumbents should aim for a 30 to 50 percent reduction in time to market by increasing the use of standardized and simplified vehicle architectures, adopting continuous development practices, and leveraging AI-driven engineering. Additionally, streamlining program management and governance structures can enhance agility, minimize bottlenecks, and reduce time-consuming decision-making processes. Relentlessly reduce product cost. Affordable pricing is a driver for EV adoption rates in Europe, especially in an economic environment in which the cost of living is a concern for many. European incumbents face stiff competition from global companies that are gaining popularity and market share because of their competitive pricing. 38 Indrabati Lahiri, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChinese car makers turn to hybrids to avoid EV tariffs from the EU,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Euronews , December 6, 2024. To offer competitive products in European markets without compromising profit margins, the industry needs a relentless focus on reducing product costs, targeting up to 20 percent savings compared with the current state. Implementing design-to-cost strategies can help address the existing cost gap, and new technologies, such as generative AI and advanced manufacturing, can help boost productivity. Furthermore, European OEMs should scrutinize cost drivers across the value chain, from raw materials to final assembly. Embrace a new era of collaboration. Given the speed and severity of disruptive forces, individual companies can aim to enhance the efficiency of their operating models, but no company can do it alone. To realize new sources of competitive advantage, close collaboration among European OEMs, suppliers, adjacent industries (such as energy and infrastructure providers), and policymakers is essential. Collaboration should span from current core competencies (including manufacturing flexibility to manage demand variability and shocks) to opportunities for additional value creation (such as innovative vehicle architecture and ADAS offerings) to enabling factors (such as charging infrastructure and the availability of skilled labor). A new era of collaboration: Eight opportunities for OEMs, suppliers, adjacent industries, and policymakers Reclaiming a competitive position requires more than just individual efforts. While automotive OEMs and suppliers have several opportunities to capture value on their own, collaboration is essential to successfully reinvigorate the European automotive industry. The interconnectedness of the automotive ecosystem necessitates close cooperation among all stakeholders, including adjacent industries and policymakers. Our research reveals eight opportunities where collaboration promises the greatest benefits for OEMs, suppliers, and adjacent industries (Exhibit 1). These collaborations can drive growth and innovation and can serve as a source of competitiveness for the European automotive industry. By working together, stakeholders can address current challenges and unlock new sources of value, ultimately paving the way for a resilient and thriving automotive sector. 1. Allow for manufacturing transparency and flexibility According to the 2024 ACEA and CLEPA members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 survey, 31 percent of respondents consider increased flexibility across product lines to be crucial for responding to demand uncertainties. OEMs and suppliers can operate more efficiently by improving manufacturing flexibility to help manage demand variability and market shocks. Simplified programmable automation can also improve flexibility between different technologies at scale. To manage drops in ICE volumes while building up BEV production, for example, certain OEMs have updated manufacturing capabilities to produce ICE and BEV powertrain equipment on the same production line or platform. Several joint actions can improve flexibility. OEMs and their suppliers can enhance automation and connectivity (through simplified broadcasting, for example) to improve the transparency and stability of volume forecasts while reducing response times. Further, OEMs and suppliers can define standardized component requirements and increase modularity to enable production lines and platforms to be shared across OEMs. For example, OEMs can consider dropping exclusivity requirements to increase suppliers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 manufacturing flexibility and reduce the cost of R&D or operational investments. Similarly, suppliers can offer more modularized components, such as modularized steering motors, so that they can follow similar manufacturing processes and have a larger share of common parts. 2. Consolidate the ICE component market Overall volumes of ICE vehicle sales are under pressure because 40 to 50 percent of EV components are nontraditional car components such as batteries and semiconductors . 39 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, October 3, 2024. Based on McKinsey analysis, components prevalently manufactured in Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as engine parts, fuel systems, and exhaust systems\u00e2\u0080\u0094worth about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac230 billion in global yearly revenue are not needed in BEV manufacturing, and ICE component markets are expected to reach their peak in 2025, with an accelerating decline after 2030. Even though some OEMs have considered prolonging their ICE vehicle programs\u00e2\u0080\u0094a European volume OEM, for example, redirected a third of its R&D budget into ICE vehicles 40 Lois Hoyal, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEVs are the future, but combustion era \u00e2\u0080\u0098is not over,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 VW CFO says,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Automotive News Europe, June 5, 2024. \u00e2\u0080\u0094the decline in the ICE component market will result in a substantial shift in component values globally, with the share of pure ICE components expected to fall from 24 percent to 8 percent in the total component market between 2024 and 2035 (Exhibit 2). Image description: Two vertical-stacked bar charts show how the market share among three internal-combustion engine (ICE) market segments may evolve between 2022 and 2030. The chart on the left shows the volume outlook globally among growing components, stable components, and sunset components, while the chart on the right shows the shift in volume outlook for each of these components by region (North America, Europe, China, and the rest of the world). Globally, the market share of growing ICE components\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as, dedicated hybrid transmissions, batteries, and sensors\u00e2\u0080\u0094is expected to more than triple by 2030. Meanwhile, the global market share of sunset components, including engine systems, transmissions, and fuel injection, is expected to cut by more than half. End image description. This scenario may materialize in a tight-knit collaboration among OEMs and suppliers that could result in a competitive advantage for ICE components. There is a need for reliable partnerships that can fulfill demand of ICE components at competitive costs. This reliability would help OEMs and suppliers to successfully manage the overall declining ICE vehicle sales volumes from a cost and delivery perspective\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, by limiting or removing price increases as economies of scale decline\u00e2\u0080\u0094and provide financial stability to suppliers so they can deliver the required volumes. OEMs, suppliers, and policy makers could consider different forms of cooperation. First, instead of optimizing costs solely for individual gains, they could consider longer term contracts and volume agreements across the value chain. For example, they could aim for global optimization when awarding contracts while considering secondary costs for necessary plant build-ups. These contracts would also help to avoid short-term EDI cancellations 41 EDIs (electronic data interchanges) are used by OEMs to notify suppliers about the call-off orders they can expect in the future. Call-offs are not binding orders, however, so OEMs can create many with one supplier and order them on short notice at lower volumes, or they can cancel their call-off orders days before the schedule delivery, which can encumber suppliers. that drive complexity and cost in the entire value chain. Second, joint commitments can help bring down costs by reducing complexity drivers such as change requests and respective R&D capacities. They can also allow for more flexibility and speed up approvals for future relocations of volumes of ICE components within production networks to allow for an effective consolidation during the market ramp-down. 3. Scale the semiconductor ecosystem The European automotive industry needs resilient and sustainable access to core technologies that could offer a competitive advantage, such as semiconductors. As of Q1 2024, Europe was able to fulfill approximately 70 percent of its total semiconductor demand with local front-end supply. 42 McKinsey analysis of Omdia data. Full autonomy for semiconductor manufacturing is neither realistic nor necessary. However, a certain market share in the different stages of the value chain is relevant to build and maintain independence. In the case of front-end manufacturing, for example, if Europe wants to prevent losing ground, an investment of $205 billion is required by 2028. 43 Halbleiterkrise: Voraussetzungen f\u00c3\u00bcr k\u00c3\u00bcnftige Relevanz, Kompetenz und Resilienz f\u00c3\u00bcr Europa ( Semiconductor crisis: Prerequisites for future relevance, competence and resilience for Europe ), VDA, May 2023. Moreover, Europe must increase its backend manufacturing capacity if it wants to sustain its current market position. These efforts will necessitate investing further and addressing factors such as labor costs to ensure the financial viability of backend manufacturing in Europe. Additionally, Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attractiveness as a semiconductor ecosystem requires strengthening resilience beyond chip manufacturing, extending to wafer manufacturing, equipment, materials, and energy supply. Looking at demand from the automotive industry only, demand is tripling through 2030. 44 Halbleiterkrise: Voraussetzungen f\u00c3\u00bcr k\u00c3\u00bcnftige Relevanz, Kompetenz und Resilienz f\u00c3\u00bcr Europa ( Semiconductor crisis: Prerequisites for future relevance, competence and resilience for Europe ), VDA, May 2023. Semiconductor manufacturing capacity is increasing rapidly, though mainly outside of Europe: through 2028, 52 percent of semiconductor front-end capacity buildout is planned to take place in China, 10 percent in the United States, and only 8 percent in Europe. Furthermore, significant investments are taking place in other regions, such as South Korea (including a planned \u00e2\u0082\u00ac430 billion investment to set up a world-leading semiconductor cluster by 2050 45 Martin Fritz, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSouth Korea invests big in becoming a global chip leader,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Deutsche Welle, January 24, 2024. ) or Taiwan. China is expected to be responsible for 60 percent of the capacity build-up of automotive-relevant mature nodes (22 nanometers or greater), whereas Europe is not building a relevant footprint. Despite a strong competitive position in early-stage R&D for new materials, process technology, and leading-edge equipment, Europe is also lagging behind in its semiconductor start-up investments\u00e2\u0080\u0094China and the United States have both seen almost twice as many investments into semiconductor companies since 2010, driven by the US CHIPS and Science Act and the Chinese National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund. 46 McKinsey Start-up Investment Landscape Analysis (SILA); Antonia Hmaidi, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term struggle to become integral in semiconductor supply chains,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mercator Institute, March 4, 2024. However, if Europe wants to sustain this stronghold, it needs to double down on early-stage R&D and strengthen capabilities for leading-edge semiconductor design. OEMs and suppliers should collaboratively seek strategic partnerships and supply agreements with major semiconductor producers to reduce supply chain vulnerability (in case of potential issues with local sourcing requirements, for example) and to build up further semiconductor capacity in Europe. At the same time, the regulatory environment will need to support an accelerated build-out of European supply. 4. Push for an industry-standard tech stack in ADAS, autonomous driving, and software defined vehicles The European automotive industry is currently falling behind Chinese OEMs and US tech players in developing distinctive and price-competitive solutions for ADAS and autonomous-driving features. European automotive companies are generally subscale compared to global tech companies and automotive market challengers, particularly in software, AI expertise, and chip technology. For instance, 43 percent of R&D employees at entrant OEMs outside Europe specialize in software, compared to just 16 percent of incumbent OEMs. Moreover, analyses on start-up deal sizes show that, since 2010, total investment into ADAS features (such as autonomous vehicle [AV] integration, ADAS components, AV software, and SLAM 47 McKinsey SILA. ) in the United States was more than 3.5 times that in Europe. 48 McKinsey SILA. At the same time, 30 percent of respondents of the 2024 CLEPA and ACEA members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 survey consider ADAS system performance an important differentiator for the European automotive industry by 2035 at the latest. To counterbalance this deficiency and increase the chance of becoming competitive in ADAS, three industry-wide collaborative efforts could prove beneficial: First, companies can align on and develop standards and open-source code for nondifferentiating elements of the ADAS tech stack within the boundaries of competition law, including, for example, abstraction layers between operating system and hardware, operating system and middleware interfaces, communication and transportation middleware, and the security layer. This standardization could lead to fewer integration efforts for suppliers and OEMs and, as such, allow for shorter time-to-market timeframes. Second, companies can foster industry collaboration for data collection, AI models, and a software development toolchain to reduce the high costs of data collection and increase ADAS safety based on more learning opportunities through edge cases. Last, policy makers could play a vital role in facilitating the definition of common standards for data sharing, system interoperability, and data handling and help develop a regulatory framework for testing driver assistance and automated systems on the road. 49 The future of European competitiveness \u00e2\u0080\u0093 In-depth analysis and recommendations , European Commission, September 9, 2024. 5. Simplify and standardize vehicle architecture Investing in vehicle architecture innovation can enhance cost-effectiveness and increase the sustainability of the manufacturing processes. For instance, adopting a zonal-based electrical/electronic (E/E) vehicle architecture (consolidating electric control units into fewer domain controllers responsible for different zones in the vehicle, for example) can save 10 to 20 percent of material costs through optimized specifications, reduce engineering expenses, accelerate the time from concept to mass production by 20 to 30 percent driven by lower number of central processors with higher performance, and improve vehicle performance throughout its lifecycle. By 2035, a McKinsey analysis projects that 35 percent of all produced vehicles will feature zonal E/E architecture, which may enable secure over-the-air updates, benefiting both OEMs and end-users. 50 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Advanced semiconductors for the era of centralized E/E architectures ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, June 29, 2024. This trend is supported by the 2024 CLEPA and ACEA members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 survey, where 59 percent of respondents identified centralized E/E architecture as a key source of strategic differentiation for cost savings by 2035. Exemplary methods to achieve cost competitiveness in manufacturing through innovative vehicle architecture include gigacasting (casting large aluminum body-in-white parts in a single piece and replacing multiple smaller parts) and unboxing (building vehicles from the inside out) - these opportunities can be captured particularly well in greenfield situations. Further cost savings can be achieved by AI-supported end-to-end supply chains, design-to-cost optimization, the integration of die-cast components into mechanical assemblies (such as using one die-cast for the rear or front wagon), and the implementation of more-functional integration, such as omitting the floor structure and mounting seats directly on top of battery housing. Rethinking vehicle architecture principles requires close collaboration between OEMs and suppliers. The development of an entirely new architecture not only implies a high degree of technological change but also requires a rapid execution to capitalize on cost savings against global competition. In this context, OEMs and suppliers should align on a shared vision to jointly move toward a zonal E/E architecture to achieve cost reductions and efficiency gains. Once this alignment has taken place, OEMs and suppliers need to define the required industry-wide standards for component commonality, recycling, and material reuse to allow technical optimization in the new architecture systems. For example, they could standardize aluminum wiring and connectors or chemical cell structures for high-voltage batteries. 6. Move into adjacent and downstream value creation European suppliers and OEMs can seize attractive growth opportunities from new and adjacent value pools that are opened by advancements in technology, evolving customer behaviors, and macroeconomic shifts (see sidebar \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdjacent value pools with big potential\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Adjacent value pools with big potential Given the potential opportunities available from leveraging vehicle data, policy makers can capture these growth opportunities by defining common standards for sharing, using, and protecting data within the boundaries of EU data protection laws while still offering a high degree of convenience for customers. OEMs, suppliers, and adjacent industries can take advantage of five adjacent value pools: Auto financing. New financing and leasing offerings, such as shifting more to \u00e2\u0080\u009cusership\u00e2\u0080\u009d (rather than ownership) models, can open new value pools for companies offering auto financing services and can open the door for further downstream access, especially for aftermarket and other services. Tailored offerings can also create opportunities for usership mobility models for passenger cars and trucks. Automotive aftermarket. The automotive aftermarket sector could also see substantial growth, potentially contributing up to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac75 billion in value added for European companies in 2035 . 1 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, October 3, 2024. As the internal-combustion-engine fleet ages, additional maintenance will be required, which will increase the demand for automotive aftermarket companies to bridge the gap to the battery-electric-vehicle transition. Aftermarket companies can develop a competitive edge by focusing on exceptional customer centricity and deploying AI-based pricing. Additionally, OEMs will need to define a clear electric-vehicle (EV) strategy, especially for end-of-life batteries, to continuously reap value from these vehicles. Digital and connected services. Across the entire life cycle, digital and connected services represent another lucrative value pool for suppliers and OEMs. By sharing and leveraging vehicle data, features such as advanced infotainment, autonomous driving, in-car entertainment, and predictive maintenance can be developed and contribute between \u00e2\u0082\u00ac27 billion and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac60 billion in value added for European companies in 2035. 2 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, October 3, 2024. Charging infrastructure. Europe needs to install, operate, and maintain an additional 410,000 charging stations each year through 2030, which could increase value added in Europe by \u00e2\u0082\u00ac60 billion to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac90 billion. 3 \u00e2\u0080\u009cElectric cars: EU needs 8 times more charging points per year by 2030 to meet CO2 targets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ACEA, April 29, 2024; \u00e2\u0080\u009c Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, October 3, 2024. Battery circularity. The automotive industry in Europe could tap into additional opportunities available from battery reuse in EVs or other means of transportation, including micromobility, by repurposing used batteries in second-life applications such as energy storage systems and recycling. Battery recycling services alone could contribute about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac13.5 billion in value by 2035. 4 McKinsey Center for Future Mobility data. Over the next 20 years, this sector could enable battery manufacturers to source more than half of the raw materials needed for new batteries from discarded, recycled batteries. 5 Franziska Maisel et al., \u00e2\u0080\u009cA forecast on future raw material demand and recycling potential of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Resources, Conservation and Recycling , May 2023, Volume 192. While the short- to midterm value of such an opportunity depends heavily on the future development of local EV battery production, battery recycling could emerge as a fundamental long-term value driver with significant value-added potential after 2035, safeguarding the industrial backbone for future electric mobility. To realize these opportunities, players from the automotive industry need to establish sufficient access to battery volumes large enough to reach a meaningful level of scale. Potential strategies include partnership agreements with OEMs and cell producers, as well as models that give incentives to EV drivers for providing access to end-of-life vehicles, thereby closing the loop . 6 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Battery recycling takes the driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, March 13, 2023. In a recent publication on Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic fortunes in the shift to EVs, 51 \u00e2\u0080\u009c Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic potential in the shift to electric vehicles ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, October 3, 2024. the MCFM showed that additional opportunities from downstream value creation could generate a further \u00e2\u0082\u00ac220 billion to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac270 billion by 2035 . For example, the global adjacent value pool for passenger cars is estimated by the MCFM to exceed \u00e2\u0082\u00ac370 billion in 2035 for energy (including power, charging services, and infrastructure), about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac900 billion for shared mobility services, and about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac180 billion for digital services. Companies need to rethink their partnering approaches when considering moves into adjacent value-creation areas. Forging strategic alliances might help share the financial burden of investing into new business ideas or aid in gaining required skills. OEMs and suppliers could profit from sharing and jointly leveraging vehicle data to develop and market features throughout the vehicle life cycle, such as in-car entertainment or predictive maintenance. Further, standardizing selected market features\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as entirely consistent and common charging standards across brands (for example, beyond common plugs only)\u00e2\u0080\u0094can enable further value creation and accelerate growth by reducing market entry barriers and can increase the scale of innovation offering. 7. Get charging and refueling infrastructure right To meet the energy demand of mobility in Europe, continued and accelerated public and private investments in infrastructure for EV charging and hydrogen refueling will be necessary. The need for these investments in Europe is large: according to McKinsey analysis, investments into EV chargers of about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac130 billion are required to meet demand (increasing the number of public charging points from about 1.0 million currently to about 2.5 million in 2030). 52 European EV charging infrastructure masterplan , ACEA, March 2022. Meeting hydrogen demand for prospective FCEVs on the road in 2030 requires investments into hydrogen generation of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac14 billion, as well as another \u00e2\u0082\u00ac6 billion to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac7 billion to set up the necessary 1,500 hydrogen refueling stations. 53 McKinsey Hydrogen Insights. Collaboration across the industry is required to get infrastructure right. Charge point operators can improve pricing transparency and offer customers attractive pricing across networks. Charge point owners could offer such pricing to MSP players, who could pass this on to their customers. The industry should align on common standards to ensure efficient capital deployment and investment in complementary infrastructure. Policy makers can help to speed up permitting processes, facilitate the buildout of energy grids and smart meters, and create a supportive environment for the rollout of vehicle-to-grid services. 8. Enhance the skills and talent base As the European automotive industry adapts to evolving product requirements and demographic changes, building a skilled workforce is paramount. Currently, Europe trails behind North America in critical skill areas, such as engineering, digital and analytics, and manufacturing. For example, according to McKinsey analysis, 51 percent of North American employees possess the required skill levels in R&D, as compared with only 42 percent in European companies. Further, new entrant OEMs outside Europe have a significantly higher share of software-focused R&D talent (about 43 percent) compared with incumbent OEMs (about 16 percent), which focus most of their R&D on hardware. OEMs and suppliers can consider two moves to advance their skill sets. First, partnerships with universities and the public sector can help build academic curriculums or develop reskilling courses that align with industry needs, which can ensure a steady pipeline of skilled professionals. These collaborations are critical to ensure skills programs are specific and cost-effective, especially for small or midsize suppliers that cannot afford such programs on their own. Two relevant initiatives are the Alliance for Batteries Technology, Training and Skills (ALBATTS), which develops curriculums and learning materials to train future skills relevant along the entire battery life cycle 54 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout albatts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Project ALBATTS, accessed December 10, 2024. ; and the Automotive Skills Alliance, a European partnership that aims to reskill 5 percent of the European automotive workforce. 55 \u00e2\u0080\u009cA skills partnership for the automotive ecosystem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Automotive Skills Alliance, accessed December 10, 2024. Second, collaborations between suppliers and OEMs that can jointly reskill existing employees are crucial to keeping up with industry demands. Some organizations have made strides to do this. For example, the European Battery Alliance already reskilled more than 100,000 workers to meet the demands of the battery value chain. 56 \u00e2\u0080\u009cInnoEnergy Skills Institute trains 100,000 workers for Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery sector,\u00e2\u0080\u009d InnoEnergy, December 5, 2024. The path to regaining the historical success of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automotive industry is long. While many challenges exist, European leaders in the auto industry, adjacent sectors, and the public sector can work together to reinvigorate the competitiveness of the European automotive industry. In turn, these efforts will also ensure the continuation of positive secondary effects to the wider European economy. Automotive players can focus on transforming their companies by implementing cost-effective strategies, continuing their investments in new technologies, and accelerating research and development. Adjacent industries can invest in enabling infrastructure, including battery technologies, energy, and semiconductors, to support the transformation and participate in adding value. And policy makers can define effective policies and regulatory environments that are attractive for these investments, therefore ensuring competitiveness with other regions. By focusing on these actions collectively, the European automotive industry can regain its competitiveness.

For more than 150 years, it has been a key driver of prosperity in the region. The European automotive and supplier industry is facing unprecedented pressure from both external and internal challenges. There is a distortion of competition, especially from heavily subsidised Chinese manufacturers, alongside difficult location factors like high-energy costs and extensive regulatory requirements such as excessive reporting obligations. Additionally, the demand for cars in general - and electric vehicles in particular - has decreased rapidly. At the same time, the industry is adjusting to the EU climate and environmental targets - the highest worldwide - whilst managing the pressing need to transition towards digital technologies. The EPP Group supports the proposal of the President of the Commission to open a Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the Automotive Sector, a process that will personally be led by the President herself, and in which participation will be required from automotive stakeholders, representatives from the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of the EU. The EPP Group demands that, as a result of this dialogue, a holistic EU strategy will be defined that helps the sector manage the various challenges and reviews the applicable EU regulatory framework. The EPP Group also sees the following immediate and long-term measures as key for preserving a globally competitive key industry that provides high-quality jobs and prosperity within Europe, all whilst achieving climate neutrality by 2050. 1. Ensuring that the Best Technologies Can Compete The EU must re-establish technological neutrality as a core guiding principle, taking into account the realities of the sector. Recent policy decisions - such as the revised CO2 emissions performance standards for cars and vans (2019/631) and heavy-duty vehicles (2019/1242) - have compromised this principle by effectively banning the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles. As technological neutrality embodies the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the ban is irreconcilable with EU law. Additionally, the current regulation focuses only on tailpipe emissions, overlooking the broader environmental impact of vehicle production, use, and disposal. This approach disproportionately favours electric vehicles and limits fair competition among different technologies. It is, therefore, essential to establish a level playing field that enables the best technologies to compete. All technologies that can contribute to achieving climate goals should be treated fairly, without favouring or biasing any particular technological solution. The EU's climate policy should prioritise market-based measures over blanket bans. This approach allows CO\u2082 reductions to be achieved at the lowest cost, while giving consumers choice and enabling engineers to compete in developing the best solutions. Consumers deserve access to the lowest-cost technologies and the best possible information to choose the mobility solution that fits their needs. Correcting the ICE Ban : The upcoming 2035 ban on internal combustion engines (ICEs) should be reversed in order to reflect technological neutrality, meaning to allow a mix of technologies while staying on track to achieve the Union's decarbonisation targets. Whilst electric vehicles (EVs) will play a major role in the transition towards a climate neutral future, other technologies can also help to achieve our climate targets. The European Commission must urgently present a revision to Regulation 2019/631 that reintroduces the technological neutral approach and acknowledges the role of all technologies in achieving CO2 reductions. The revision should recognise the role of alternative fuels, including e-fuels, biofuels, renewable or synthetic fuels, by providing explicit exemptions, accompanied by other measures such as introducing a carbon-correction factor, thus revising the ICE ban from 2035 onwards. Within this revision, the Commission should also propose a definition for carbon-neutral fuels, ensuring an appropriate reduction in emissions compared to conventional fuels, ultimately reaching climate neutrality by 2050. It should also acknowledge the role of other technologies, such as plug-in hybrids (PHEV), and ensure adequate enabling conditions across the EU, such as the availability and affordability of EVs, recharging and refuelling infrastructure and alternative fuels. Review: Given the long development processes in the automotive industry, the EU Commission must move the scheduled review for Regulation (EU) 2019/631 forward to 2025 in order to correct the ICE ban and provide the sector with legal certainty and planning security as soon as possible. While a combination of policies is needed, it is important to note that the positive climate impact of the ETS by 2030 is estimated to be 25-times-higher than those of Regulation 2019/631. This limited climate impact must be taken into account while weighing the targets against imminent job losses and deindustrialisation in Europe. Heavy-duty Vehicles and Trailer Targets: European emission reduction targets must be ambitious yet realistic for the industry to achieve. The recent revision of the Regulation on CO2 emissions performance standards for heavy-duty vehicles (Regulation (EU) 2019/1242) failed to achieve this balance. By the end of 2026, the Commission should review Regulation 2019/1242 and adjust the heavy-duty vehicles and trailer targets to ease burdens on mid-cap companies and adopt a technology-neutral approach by recognising the role of alternative fuels. Avoid Penalties: The sales market for electric cars is not developing as expected. Sales figures are lagging behind expectations, and manufacturers are at risk of failing to reach their 2025 emission reduction target, resulting in potential fines in the billions. In the current crisis, manufacturers need their revenues to master the transformation. The Commission should carry out an analysis of the current situation and the expected development in the 2025 review and then decide which measures are needed to maintain the competitiveness of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). These temporary relief measures could include options such as allowing banking and accounting of parts of sales, assessing compliance based on a three-year average, or temporarily adjusting the calculation method for penalties to take into account cars produced and not only cars registered. All these measures should take into account the efforts and investments that companies have already taken and thus avoid legal challenges. If penalties are unavoidable, they need to be reinvested in the European automotive sector for specific purposes (e.g. for infrastructure deployment, incentive schemes, digitalisation) instead of the general EU budget. It is necessary to prioritise pooling alliances within the EU or with like-minded partners to ensure that OEMs can enhance their competitiveness without giving advantages to external players. Synergy Effects With Other Sectors and Market-based Measures: Achieving climate goals requires decarbonising not only new vehicles but also the existing fleet. By allowing a variety of technologies beyond 2035, we can increase the use of alternative fuels, which are also compatible with current vehicles while allowing space for future innovation. Sectors that depend entirely on alternative fuels for decarbonisation would also benefit from this expanded market. In the context of Union-wide climate targets for 2040, it is also vital to acknowledge the production and use of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels including, from non-biological and biological origins and recycled carbon fuels from non-sustainable industrial processes as carbon-neutral beyond 2040. This recognition would promote synergies between transportation and industrial decarbonisation, balancing the supply and demand of e-fuels, biofuels and carbon-neutral synthetic fuels, while also helping both sectors lower their carbon footprints. Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) : It is of utmost importance that the EU finally develops a comprehensive LCA methodology by December 2025 to evaluate the environmental impact of vehicles from production to disposal and introduce it into the EU legislation. The Commission, having had the task of coming up with an LCA methodology since 2019, should introduce the LCA in Regulation 2019/631 and in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 as soon as possible, finally respecting the will of the EU legislator. 2. Accelerating Infrastructure Roll-Out The suitability for everyday use and social acceptance of EVs depends largely on price affordability, the development of the electricity grid, the provision and functionality of the charging infrastructure, as well as the installation of charging points in buildings. The lack of adequate charging and refuelling infrastructure is a significant obstacle to the widespread adoption of EVs and other sustainable technologies. Whilst the installation of infrastructure for light-duty vehicles is lagging behind, the infrastructure for heavy-duty vehicles is practically non-existent. The EU and its Member States must act decisively to build the required infrastructure. We need a comprehensive infrastructure offensive that safeguards an equitable distribution between Member States and regions. Infrastructure Investment: Simplified permitting processes and financial incentives should drive the roll-out of publicly accessible charging stations and refuelling points as well as the installation of charging points in buildings. The lengthy grid connection and permitting processes in Europe significantly delay the roll-out of charging infrastructure. The European Commission and Member States should do their utmost to improve permitting procedures, scale up electricity production, increase grid capacity, provide additional funding sources, and consider introducing mandatory deadlines for approvals, as seen in the Critical Raw Materials Acts (CRMA) and the Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA). Infrastructure Deployment: The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) has set concrete targets for the deployment of refuelling and recharging infrastructure. Member States must ensure a coherent and consistent implementation to unlock the full potential of the Single Market. However, it is also clear that more ambition is needed. Member States and the Commission should work together to ensure that additional infrastructure is deployed, e.g. through public-private partnerships, especially in less developed regions. The review of AFIR should go hand in hand with the review of Regulation 2019/631 and lead to more ambitious targets, in particular for heavy-duty-vehicles infrastructure. The Member States should also improve shared charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in buildings. 3. Supply Chain Resilience and Rules-Based International Trade The automotive industry operates in a highly competitive international environment. Europe needs to ensure a level playing field between domestic and foreign producers. Where unfair practices such as dumping or unfair subsidies occur, the EU must take countervailing measures. At the same time, the EU automotive industry is highly dependent on critical raw materials (CRM) for battery production, which are largely sourced from a small number of countries. The EU must diversify and secure its supply chains to ensure sustainable production in the long term. Trade Agreements and International Cooperation : In order to diversify the supply chains, reduce dependencies and open new markets for the EU economy, the EU should finalise ongoing negotiations on trade agreements, initiate new negotiations and other forms of international cooperation with countries or regions such as ASEAN, and strengthen existing relationships with other third countries. Circular Economy Requirements: Efficient circular economy business models can play a significant role to help reduce reliance on imported raw materials, contributing to the sustainability of EV battery production within Europe. Regulation 2023/0284 on circularity requirements for vehicle design and on the management of end-of-life vehicles needs to strengthen circular business models by setting up a framework that facilitates and supports the EU automotive sector to develop itself as a leader in sustainable automotive innovation and strengthen the sector's competitiveness while reducing strategic dependencies. Raw Materials: A clear strategy for implementing the Critical Raw Materials Act as well as an ambitious action plan for CRMs that goes beyond those laid out in the CRMA is indispensable to support the CRM value chain, including the establishment of new production capacities and ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector. Within the EU, there are significant opportunities for extracting Critical Raw Materials essential for battery production and electrification. Additionally, the European Commission should collaborate with the automotive and mining industry to explore potential joint ventures for sourcing, extracting, and processing these materials, ensuring a predictable and sustainable supply chain for critical raw materials. As part of its Strategic Partnership agenda, the EU should financially support European companies' key projects in third countries to enable European companies to secure and diversify their supply of critical minerals, and ensure that critical minerals from Strategic Partner countries are directed to Europe. The EU should also foster the exchange of best practices, such as JOGMEC in Japan. Countering Unfair Practices: The European Commission has appropriately imposed anti-subsidy duties on the imports of battery electric vehicles originating from China. However, negotiations should continue to find a solution to the dispute as anti-subsidy duties are a measure of last resort. The Commission should also closely monitor any circumvention attempts and make full use of the instruments under the foreign direct subsidy regulation. In the event such practices are identified, it will swiftly activate the available trade defence instruments, including anti-subsidy and anti-dumping measures, while ensuring the continuation of diplomatic dialogue to resolve disputes. Reciprocity: The EU should address global structural trade imbalances with China and other economies by applying multilateral trade rules, enhancing EU trade tools, pro-actively supporting the reform of the WTO and firmly upholding the principle of reciprocity. 4. Promoting Innovation and Research & Development Europe must strengthen its global leadership in automotive innovation by investing in forward-looking technologies like autonomous driving, Artificial Intelligence and alternative fuels. Enhancing R&D capabilities will position the EU to compete effectively in the global market. Additionally, increased funding is essential to support the transformation of the automotive sector and the regions impacted. Increased R&D Funding : The EU should raise direct funding for automotive R&D, prioritising AI, autonomous driving and alternative fuels. Partnerships between the public and private sectors should be promoted in order to accelerate innovation and facilitate deployment. The EU should take appropriate measures to prevent illegal technology transfers and protect the intellectual property rights of European companies. Aid for Regions Affected : The EU's Industrial Action Plan for the automotive sector should propose financial support measures (e.g. the Extension of the Just Transition Fund beyond 2027) to aid regions affected by the sector's transformation. Furthermore, targeted financial support schemes should not focus exclusively on the construction of new production facilities, but also on the transformation of existing facilities . Therefore, the European Commission should conduct a review of state aid guidelines to allow targeted funding schemes that address the industrial transition needs of companies, including suppliers, more effectively while maintaining fair competition among Member States. Reskilling & Upskilling: To strengthen the skills and capabilities of the current and future workforce, effective upskilling and reskilling programs must be implemented, addressing labour market demands, workforce shortages, and an ageing population. The closure of factories, relocation to third countries and job losses in Europe underscore the risks facing the automotive sector when competitiveness is overlooked. Foster EU Production: Carbon leakage in the automotive sector poses a significant threat. Importing electric vehicles from external markets like China, where emissions standards may differ, risks transferring emissions rather than achieving real global reductions. To genuinely ensure emission reductions, it is essential that EVs and key components are produced within Europe, preserving jobs, economic value, innovation and high environmental standards. Financial aid should prioritise vehicles manufactured in the EU, reinforcing local production and ensuring resilience against external dependencies. Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) : IPCEIs are crucial in attracting investment to critical digital and green automotive technologies in Europe. However, reforming the IPCEI framework is necessary to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and predictability of the application process without disrupting the EU internal market. Data Access : The European Commission should introduce sector-specific regulations on access to in-vehicle data, supplementing the Data Act. This regulation should facilitate better access to in-vehicle data while ensuring the highest standard of cybersecurity and data protection. The Commission should also review and streamline the existing legislative framework to minimise administrative burdens by reducing overlaps. The European Commission should also actively promote the expansion of secure cross-border data transfers. Better access to globally connected and secure data is crucial, especially for advancing research and development in autonomous driving and vehicle safety. Steer Demand : To boost the sales of sustainable vehicles, Member States should introduce innovative support schemes such as purchase incentives, VAT reductions, or subsidised leasing. To aid this, the EU Commission should foster the exchange of best practices and publish guidelines to ensure that European producers truly benefit. To support potential national projects, the EU should consider advancing revenues from ETS 2 (Social Climate Fund and national income) with the help of the European Investment Bank. Additionally, the Commission should ensure that national ETS-2 revenues are used effectively and support households in transitioning to clean mobility. 5. Simplifying the Regulatory Framework The complexity of the current regulatory framework and the excessive reporting obligations are some of the biggest barriers to innovation and growth within Europe. Concrete action is needed. Stress Test of the EU Acquis : The EU should conduct a comprehensive review of all existing legislation, including secondary legislation, affecting the automotive sector. A simplified, harmonised and streamlined regulatory environment and reporting obligations will reduce compliance costs and make it easier for companies to focus on innovation. The application of the \"One-in-Two-out\"-rule should be a guiding principle for future legislation. The Commission should also examine how digital one-stop solutions can simplify and facilitate compliance with reporting obligations and how they can be implemented. Simplification of Secondary Legislation: To create a more streamlined and transparent regulatory environment, the EU should introduce a simplification process for secondary legislation. This could include actions such as grouping related regulatory requirements into batches and systematically phasing out outdated regulations within a 5-year timeframe. Mandatory Competitiveness Checks : Any new legislative and policy proposal, including secondary legislation, must undergo an extensive Competitiveness Check before its publication, examining its potential impacts on the competitiveness of Europe and European companies globally. The Commission should commit to present legislative and policy proposals only if they have no negative effect on competitiveness and have explicitly received a positive opinion from the Regulatory Scrutiny Board. Conclusion The EPP Group supports a comprehensive strategy to address these major challenges through flexible, technology-neutral policies that encourage innovation, support infrastructure development, protect jobs, maintain both Europe's global competitiveness and deliver on our climate ambitions. Europe must remain a strong, competitive location for the automotive and supplier industry, enabling it to lead in this new era of transformation while fulfilling its role in reaching ambitious climate goals. The EPP Group stands ready to support the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the Automotive Sector and expects from the new Commission a commitment to revise Regulation 2019/631 as soon as possible in 2025. This revision should revise the ICE ban, help avoid penalties, develop enabling conditions, and increase the efforts for infrastructure deployment in order to make the European automotive industry competitive whilst achieving the decarbonisation of the transport sector, thus contributing to the EU's climate neutrality target for 2050.

In 2023, the value added by non-EU countries in the production of vehicles for export by the EU automotive sector slightly decreased compared to 2022, suggesting a halt in the growing dependence on external providers. In 2023, the value added generated in the Chinese automotive industry due to the EU final use amounted to \u20ac4.0 billion, up from \u20ac1.2 billion in 2010. In 2023, Germany and Poland recorded the largest number of jobs in the EU automotive industry driven by foreign final use, with 274 000 and 109 000 people, respectively. However, these jobs constitute only 0.6% of their overall employment. [[File:Employment and value added using FIGARO data - view into the automotive industry RE 16 07 2025.xlsx]] Domestic and foreign value added embodied in EU automotive exports EU 2010-2023 Source: Eurostat (online data codes: naio_10_fgde, naio_10_fgfeie) This article delves into gross value added and employment in the EU associated with the global value chains (GVCs) in the automotive industry that serves as a classic example of GVCs in Europe. The Draghi Report dedicates a comprehensive chapter to the history, relevance, current status, and challenges faced by the European Union (EU) in this arena. The data analysis focuses on NACE industry C29, encompassing motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers (hereafter referred to as motor vehicles). For simplicity, the terms \u201cvehicles\u201d, \"cars\", and \u201cautomotive,\u201d as well as \u201cindustry\u201d and \u201csector,\u201d are used interchangeably throughout. This article explores the macroeconomic globalisation indicators derived from the FIGARO tables \u2013 full international and global accounts for research in input-output analysis \u2013 and which use the Leontief input-output model ( Miller and Blair, 2022 ). Indeed, GVCs are often not immediately visible in conventional trade statistics, which typically report the total value of a product at the point of trade. What are global value chains The production of goods and services relies on inputs, which can be sourced locally or globally. The final value of a product reflects the value that has been added in the different stages of the production chain, through the combination of factors of production, including employment . Gross value added may be generated, and employment may be located, in multiple countries. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as global value chains (GVCs), which have significantly transformed international trade over the past few decades. GVCs have driven economic growth, innovation, and shaped global production networks, fostering a complex and interconnected world. By fragmenting production across borders, GVCs have capitalised on lower transportation costs and digital infrastructure. However, recent geopolitical events have disrupted the value chains, reshaping the global landscape. In response, countries are adopting policy measures, such as tariffs and export controls, to safeguard their economic security. Under the political guidelines 2024-2029 of the European Commission's President von der Leyen , resilient and strategically managed GVCs will become increasingly crucial for navigating global trade and maintaining economic stability. Value added in trade In 2023, the automotive industry accounted for 1.8% (\u20ac273 billion) of the EU\u2019s total gross value added (\u20ac15 545 billion). Germany was the largest contributor, with a value added of \u20ac160 billion (4.2% of the country's total gross value added), followed by Italy (\u20ac17.5 billion, 0.9%), France (\u20ac15.4 billion, 0.6%), Spain (\u20ac14.3 billion, 1.0%), Czechia (\u20ac12.4 billion, 4.3%), Sweden (\u20ac10.9 billion, 2.2%), and Poland (\u20ac9.3 billion, 1.4%). The automotive industry\u2019s value added is generated to supply domestic consumption and exports. In 2023, EU exports of automotive products to non-EU countries reached \u20ac254.7 billion, representing 6.9% of the EU\u2019s total exports (\u20ac3 688 billion). Meanwhile, EU imports of products of the automotive industry amounted to \u20ac113.2 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of \u20ac124.5 billion. A more detailed analysis of value added in trade reveals that EU exports of automotive products to non-EU countries contained \u20ac196 billion of domestic value added in 2023 (see Figure 1). This indicator, calculated from an EU perspective, represents the gross value added generated in the EU economy by its exports to non-EU economies, and includes value added from different EU countries and industries (spillover effects) within the EU, reflecting the industry\u2019s complex supply chains. In contrast, foreign value added in EU automotive exports to non-EU countries (i.e. gross value added generated outside of the EU by the exports of the EU economy to non-EU economies) generated \u20ac50.1 billion of gross value added outside the EU in 2023. Between 2020 and 2022, the EU\u2019s automotive industry relied increasingly on foreign suppliers for materials, parts, and intermediate goods. This trend, known as vertical specialisation or backward linkage, may be driven by increases in prices, volumes, or both. However, in 2023, the foreign value added in EU exports slightly decreased, indicating a pause in the previously growing trend. Figure 1: Domestic and foreign value added embodied in EU automotive exports, EU, 2010-2023 Source: Eurostat (naio_10_fgde) and (naio_10_fgfeie) Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the involvement of the EU main trading partners in EU vehicles exports over time. Regarding the value added generated in the EU by EU exports (Figure 2), the United Kingdom held the largest share in 2023 (17.6%), closely followed by the United States (17.0%) and China (15.5%). The significance of EU exports to China, in terms of EU domestic value added for the automotive sector, increased substantially from 2010 to 2021 (from 8.6% to 19.3%) but then decreased in 2022 (18.6%) and 2023 (15.5%). Conversely, the share of EU domestic value added in exports to the United Kingdom declined from 22.6% to 16.2% between 2015 and 2021 but then rose in 2022 (16.4%) and 2023 (17.6%). T\u00fcrkiye and Switzerland also represent significant players for the EU domestic value added in automotive sector exports, with shares of 6.7% and 5.0%, respectively, in 2023. The United Kingdom was also the largest player in terms of value added generated outside the EU by EU exports in 2023, accounting for 18.6% of the total value added in non-EU countries from EU automotive exports (Figure 3). Although the share for this country fell from 24.0% in 2015 to 16.5% in 2021, it rebounded to 17.4% in 2022 and 18.6% in 2023, still not reaching its earlier peak. The United States was the second-largest player for the foreign value added in EU automotive exports in 2023, with a share of 16.5%. The share of value added generated in this country recorded the same trend, with a decrease from 17.7% in 2015 to 14.1% in 2021, followed by increases to 16.1% in 2022 and 16.5% in 2023. China, ranking third in 2023 with a share of 14.9%, displayed a different pattern, reaching its highest share of 18.8% in 2021. In this case also, T\u00fcrkiye and Switzerland were significant players, with shares for the foreign value added in EU exports of 7.0% and 4.8%, respectively, in 2023. Analysing the domestic (Figure 2) and foreign (Figure 3) value added in EU automotive exports reveals that the United Kingdom, the United States and China are the key players in the automotive industry, not only as significant importers of EU vehicles but also as a crucial suppliers of inputs required by the EU automotive sector for its exports. Figure 2: Domestic value added embodied in EU automotive exports, EU, by main trading partners, 2010-2023 Figure 3: Foreign value added embodied in EU automotive exports, EU, by main trading partners, 2010-2023 Value added in final use This section explores the value added contribution of the EU automotive industry (domestic value added) to the final use of goods and services in non-EU countries. It also analyses how much value added is generated in the automotive industries of non-EU countries (foreign value added) due to the final use of goods and services of the EU. This approach differs from the one presented in the previous section, which examined the value added contribution of the entire EU economy in the EU exports of the automotive industry to non-EU countries. Figure 4 illustrates the changes in the EU domestic automotive industry value added due to non-EU final use from 2010 to 2023. This indicator shows an upward trend, increasing from \u20ac52.7 billion in 2010 to \u20ac85.3 billion in 2017, before declining to \u20ac63.8 billion in 2020, and then rising again to a peak of \u20ac91.6 billion in 2023. The foreign automotive industry value added from EU final use displays a comparable, though less pronounced, trend. It rose from \u20ac14.9 billion in 2010 to \u20ac30.9 billion in 2019, experienced a brief dip to \u20ac26.0 billion in 2020, and then climbed again to \u20ac34.4 billion in 2023. Figure 4: Domestic and foreign value added in final use, EU, 2010-2023 Source: Eurostat (naio_10_fgdf) A detailed evolution of the domestic value added of the EU automotive industry resulting from non-EU final use, broken by partner country, is provided in the interactive Figure 5. In 2023, the United States represented 20.0% of the total EU automotive industry domestic value added ending up in the final use of non-EU consumers, making that country the largest contributor to the EU value added for the automotive industry. China was the second-largest contributor in 2023; its share increased from 9.1% in 2010 to 19.6% in 2021, before reverting to 16.2% in 2023. The third-largest contributor to the EU automotive value added in 2023 was the United Kingdom, with 14.6% of the EU automotive\u2019s domestic value added generated for the non-EU final use. Together, the United States, China, and the United Kingdom accounted for more than half of the value added generated in the EU automotive industry due to the foreign final use of goods and services in 2023. T\u00fcrkiye and Switzerland, ranking fourth and fifth respectively, are also important market for the EU automotive industry. The foreign value added generated in non-EU automotive industries by EU final use reached \u20ac34.4 billion in 2023. This reflects an increase in nominal terms of 130% since 2010 (\u20ac14.9 billion), and 6% compared with 2022 (\u20ac32.3 billion). Figure 6 illustrates the role of EU final use as a driver of non-EU value added generation, highlighting the contribution from each non-EU country for the period 2010 to 2023. In 2023, Japan accounted for the largest share of value added in the non-EU automotive industry due to EU final use, at 14.2%. The United Kingdom followed with a share of 12.4%. Both countries have experienced significant decreases in their shares in recent years, Japan recording its highest share in 2010 (22.5%) and the United Kingdom in 2014 (21.1%). Chinese automotive producers ranked third in 2023 in terms of EU foreign value added generated by EU final use, with a share of 11.6%, after having peaked at 12.6% in 2022. Collectively, China, Japan, and the United Kingdom accounted for more than one third (38%) of the total EU foreign automotive value added due to EU final use in 2023. Other important countries that generate value added in their automotive industry due to EU final use include T\u00fcrkiye, Mexico, South Korea, and the United States, with shares of 9.9%, 8.5%, 7.3%, and 6.3%, respectively, in 2023. Figure 5: Value added generated in the EU automotive industry by non-EU final use, by main trading partner, 2010-2023 Figure 6: Value added generated in the non-EU automotive industry by EU final use, by main trading partner, 2010-2023 Exposure to trade disruptions The EU automotive industry has strong bilateral relationships with the United States and China. Two angles have been addressed previously: the value added in trade (EU value added in exports), and the value added in final use (EU value added in foreign final use). When appropriately combined, these 2 approaches become an indication of the overall exposure to trade disruptions. This exposure indicator provides a comprehensive view of all linkages between the EU and a target country. For instance, in 2023, the EU exposure towards the United States in the automotive industry reached a peak of \u20ac19.1 billion (see Figure 7). This figure represents the sum of the EU value added in various categories, including: final exports intermediate exports to the United States ending up in its final use, or in a third country\u2019s final use intermediate exports to a third country ending up in the United States. Also, relations with China have been increasing throughout the last decade, from \u20ac5.2 billion in 2010 to \u20ac15.9 billion in 2023. In 2022, the exposure the EU had with China was very close to the one with the United States (17.2% versus 17.5%). EU relationships with both the United States and China in the automotive sector are primarily characterised by greater growth in the EU exposure to these two countries rather than in their exposure to the EU (see Figure 7). From the EU perspective, automotive industry of China has become more exposed to the EU final use of goods and services in recent years, increasing from \u20ac1.3 billion in 2010 to \u20ac4.6 billion in 2023. This growth reflects the rapid integration of the Chinese automotive industry not only into EU final use but also into third-country final use through EU production and into third-country production for EU final use. The exposure of the United States towards the EU also increased over the last decade, though to a lesser extent, rising from \u20ac1.4 billion in 2010 to \u20ac2.5 billion in 2023. Figure 7: Exposure of the EU towards the United States and China, and of the United States and China towards the EU, automotive industry, 2010-2023 Source: Eurostat (naio_10_fgtex) Employment in the automotive sector Examining EU employment triggered by foreign final use provides another lens through which to understand the impact of global value chains on European lives. In 2023, approximately 851 000 workers in the EU automotive industry were employed to meet final demand abroad. Although this represents a decline of 81 000 jobs from the peak in 2015, it remains a significant portion of the automotive industry\u2019s workforce (i.e. 35% of the 2.47 million people working in the EU automotive industry). Among the EU countries, Germany recorded the largest number of workers in the automotive sector employed to satisfy EU foreign final use, with 274 000 workers in 2023. Poland, Czechia, Romania, and Italy followed with 109 000, 66 000, 62 000 and 58 000 workers, respectively. In contrast, Cyprus and Luxembourg have very few workers employed in the automotive sector to meet EU foreign final use. However, these numbers are in line with the size of the countries. Map 1 offers a representation of the EU countries categorised according to the share of people employed in the automotive industry whose job is linked to the foreign final use of goods and services compared to the total employment of the country, expressed as ratio per thousand of people. In 2023, Slovakia (18%) and Czechia (12%) had the highest shares of people employed in the automotive sector whose job was supported by the foreign final use. Hungary (9%), Romania (7%) as well as Germany, Poland and Sweden (all three 6%) also recorded high percentages. In line with the EU average, the shares for Austria and Slovenia each reached 4%. All the other EU countries reported figures below the EU average. Map 1: Employment supported by foreign final use, automotive industry, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (naio_10_fgdfe) Source data for tables and graphs Download Excel file All FIGARO data, for inter-country supply, use, input-out tables and macroeconomic globalisation indicators, including value added and employment, are also available from Circabc . Data sources Concept and definitions Macroeconomic globalisation indicators presented in this article are computed using the FIGARO tables, through the application of the Leontief input-output model. This model relies on the interdependencies between industries and countries, represented mathematically in the form of technical coefficient matrices. The Leontief inverse matrix is derived, which captures the total direct and indirect effects of changes in final use across countries and industries. The FIGARO tables are a statistical product of the integrated global accounts for economic modelling. They are constructed by combining multiple data sources, including National Accounts Main Aggregates (NAMA), Supply and Use Tables (SUTs), Input-Output Tables (IOTs), and trade statistics for goods and services. Meeting standards from the European system of national and regional accounts (ESA 2010) , the methodology ensures alignment with National Accounts concepts, and integrates adjustments for trade asymmetries and valuation differences. The FIGARO tables link national accounts and data on business, trade and employment for tor the 27 EU Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, and Sweden), 5 EU candidate countries (Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and T\u00fcrkiye), and 17 main EU trading partners (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Norway, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). A 'rest of the world' region completes the FIGARO tables. The FIGARO tables present the relationship between economies at a detailed level of 64 industries and 64 products, following the NACE and CPA classifications, as defined in the ESA 2010 national accounts transmission programme . Key steps in the FIGARO process involve harmonising classifications, estimating trade margins, and balancing bilateral trade flows between countries, aligned with National Accounts. This process generates inter-country supply, use and input-output tables that detail the flows of goods and services across industries and countries, enabling comprehensive analysis of global value chains, production, and environmental impacts. The following main applications are produced based on the FIGARO tables: macroeconomic globalisation indicators, greenhouse gas footprints linked to final consumption and investment in the EU. Indicators The following macroeconomic globalisation indicators are calculated: Imports by industry = the total imports (intra- and extra-EU) of goods and services for the intermediate and final uses of the EU. The values are measured in basic prices and differ from the international trade statistics, which are measured in CIF values and do not follow the national accounts concepts. They measured in million euros. Exports by industry = the total exports (intra- and extra-EU) of goods and services for intermediate and final uses. The values are measured in basic prices and differ from the international trade statistics, which are measured in FOB values and do not follow the national accounts concepts. They are measured in million euros. Domestic value added in exports - EU perspective = the gross value added generated in the EU by its exports to non-EU economies. It reflects the value added generated in the EU economy, by the direct and indirect production of products for export. It is measured in thousand euros and as percentage of EU exports. Domestic value added in exports - country perspective = the gross value added generated in a EU country by its exports to other countries (EU and non-EU ones). It reflects the value added generated in the EU country, by the direct and indirect production of products for export. It is measured in thousand euros and as percentage of the EU country's exports. Foreign value added in exports - EU perspective = the gross value added generated outside the EU by its exports to non-EU economies. It refers to the value added generated in non-EU economies by the imports of goods and services used by the EU economy to produce other goods and services for export. It is measured in thousand euros and as percentage of EU exports. Foreign value added in exports - country perspective = the gross value added generated outside the EU country by its exports to other countries (EU and non-EU ones). It refers to the value added generated in the other countries by the imports of goods and services used by the EU country to produce other goods and services for export. It is measured in thousand euros and as percentage of EU country\u2019s exports. Domestic value added in foreign final use = the gross value added generated in a EU economy (in the EU as a whole or in a specific EU country) by the final use abroad (outside the EU or -outside the specific EU country, respectively). It captures the value added created in the EU as a whole or in the specific EU country along the value chain of goods and services that are used by final consumers abroad. It is measured in thousand euros. Foreign value added in domestic final use = the gross value added generated abroad by the domestic final use of the EU as a whole or of a specific EU country. It reflects the foreign value added incorporated into the domestic final use of products of the EU economy, highlighting how industries abroad are connected to the final consumers in the EU as a whole or in the specific EU country. It is measured in thousand euros. Global value chain participation - EU perspective = the sum of backward and forward participation from the EU perspective. The backward participation is calculated as a share of foreign (non-EU) value added in EU exports. The forward participation is calculated as the domestic value added generated in the EU by non-EU economies\u2019 exports. It is also measured as a share of EU exports. Global value chain participation - country perspective = the sum of backward and forward participation from the country perspective. The backward participation is calculated as a share of foreign (EU and non-EU) value added in a EU country's exports. The forward participation is calculated as the domestic value added generated in a EU country by other countries' exports. It is also measured as a share of the EU country's total exports. Trading partner exposure = the domestic gross value added generated by the exports of an economy to a trade partner directly and indirectly through third countries. This indicator is built up on domestic value added in exports and domestic value added in foreign final use, and enables a more comprehensive assessment of the dependencies and potential vulnerabilities between the EU and its trade partners. It is measured in thousand euros. Domestic employment in exports - EU perspective = the employment in the EU supported by its exports (extra-EU). It reflects the employment supported in the EU by the production in the EU economy of products for export. It is measured in number of persons and as a percentage of the total EU employment. Domestic employment in exports - country perspective = the employment in an EU country supported by its exports (intra and extra-EU). It reflects the employment supported in the country by the production in its own economy of products for export. It is measured in number of persons and as a percentage of the total EU country\u2019s employment. Domestic employment in foreign final use = the employment in a EU economy (in the EU as a whole or in a specific EU country) supported by the final use abroad (outside the EU or outside the specific EU country, respectively). It captures the employment supported in the EU as a whole or in the specific EU country along the value chain of goods and services that are used by final consumers abroad. It is measured in number of persons and as a percentage of the total employment in the EU or in the EU country. More information on the indicators, their definition and use can be found in the Statistical Working Paper Macroeconomic globalisation indicators based on FIGARO. Insights into the measurement of value added and employment in the EU . It is worth mentioning that the macroeconomic globalisation indicators provide results in values (not differentiating between prices and volumes). Hence, results and conclusions about dependence in global value chains must be carefully considered. Frequency and availability The FIGARO tables and applications, including the macroeconomic globalisation indicators, are produced and updated annually. In 2025, the time series from 2010 to 2023 has been published (period T +24 months, T being the year of release). The time series is in line with the latest macroeconomic aggregates. More information For more information, please refer to the thematic section for the supply, use, input-output and FIGARO tables . Context Partners The FIGARO tables are the result of a long-term collaboration between Eurostat and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre . Both partners also collaborate within the GIANT initiative (Global Input-Output Accounts), which is an global inter-agency network comprising the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UN-ECLAC), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UN-ECA), and the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which aims to explore synergies and common action among the various initiatives on the compilation of multi-country (extended) supply, use, and input-output tables. Purpose The FIGARO tables provide the first official inter-country supply, use and input-output data for the EU. They are a tool for analysing the social, economic and environmental effects of globalisation. These may be analysed through studies on competitiveness, growth, productivity, employment, environmental footprint and international trade (for example, analyses of global value chains). The tables are used to evaluate EU policies and assess the economic interdependencies of the EU (or the euro area or individual EU countries) in a globalised world.
