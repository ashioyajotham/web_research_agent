  * Average CO2 emissions for the passenger car fleet of new vehicles in Europe was around 5.5 million grams below the legal target 
  * Volkswagen CEO Ralf Brandstätter: “We are making rapid progress in the transformation towards e-mobility and decarbonization and are making an important contribution to meeting the Paris climate goals.”
  * Deliveries of all-electric vehicles in 2021 doubled
  * Electric offensive will continue to gain momentum in 2022 with new models 

Based on preliminary figures, Volkswagen Passenger Cars has exceeded the
ambitious European CO2 fleet targets for 2021 and produced around 5.5 million
grams fewer CO2 than required by law. The passenger car fleet of new vehicles
in the European Union achieved average CO2 emissions of 113 g/km – the legal
CO2 target for the brand was 119 g/km. In 2021, the realistic WLTP standard
replaced the old NEDC. Volkswagen had already over-fulfilled the targets for
2020.

“By significantly exceeding our CO2 targets once again, we have demonstrated
our fast and systematic approach to sustainability and the transformation
towards e-mobility through our ACCELERATE strategy. We are thus making an
important contribution to meeting the Paris climate goals. This year, we
adding to the momentum with our new models,” said Volkswagen CEO Ralf
Brandstätter.

Last year, Volkswagen delivered more electric vehicles worldwide than ever
before, handing over more than 369,000 electric cars (+73 percent versus
2020), including approximately 106,000 PHEVs (+33 percent) and 263,000 all-
electric vehicles (+97 percent) to customers. The Group thus doubled its BEV
deliveries year-on-year.

Volkswagen will again increase its investments in the future over the next
five years – to around €18 billion. Most of this, almost €14 billion, will be
spent on e-mobility – for example for the development of further new models
and the transformation of our plants towards e-mobility. In addition, there
will be more than €1 billion for hybridizat... [Content truncated, 1613 more characters]
