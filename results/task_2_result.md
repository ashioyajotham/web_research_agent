_China and the United States held their first intergovernmental meeting on
artificial intelligence (AI) in Geneva, Switzerland on May 14, 2024._

China and the United States held their first intergovernmental meeting on
artificial intelligence (AI) on May 14. The session followed [months of
preparations](https://www.eurasiareview.com/07062024-the-uss-grip-on-china-in-

Xi-Biden presidential talks during the November 2023 [Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation Summit](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2023/11/three-

states-biden-xi-geneva-506da7b5fa72d5fe1bcd54fb8ec4f898) such AI talks “an
important part of responsibly managing competition” by helping make the world
safer. Nathaniel C. Fick, the first U.S. Ambassador at Large for Cyberspace
and Digital Policy, [said](https://www.state.gov/briefings-foreign-press-
centers/the-united-states-international-cyberspace-and-digital-policy-
strategy) the AI communication channel “will allow the United States and China
to find areas to collaborate and work together, even as they compete in other
areas.” Both governments participated in last year’s inaugural AI Safety
Summit in the United Kingdom (which issued the [so-called Bletchley
