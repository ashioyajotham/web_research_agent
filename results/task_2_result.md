High-level envoys from the United States and China are set to meet in Geneva for talks about artificial intelligence including the risks of the technology and ways to set shared standards to manage it. The meeting Tuesday is billed as an opening exchange of views in an inter-governmental dialogue on AI agreed during a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in San Francisco. (Doug Mills/The New York Times via AP, Pool, File) By JAMEY KEATEN Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit GENEVA (AP) \u2014 Top envoys from the U.S. and China huddled in closed-door talks in Geneva on Tuesday to discuss ways to ensure that emerging artificial intelligence technologies don\u2019t become existential risks. The talks, which Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping agreed to launch in last 2023, are meant to open up bilateral dialogue between the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2014 and increasingly, geopolitical rivals \u2014 on a fast-moving technology that already has consequences for trade, lifestyles, culture, politics, national security and defense and much more. U.S. technology experts say the meeting \u2014 led on the American side by high-level White House and State Department officials \u2014 could offer a glimpse into Beijing\u2019s thinking about AI amid a generally tight-lipped Chinese approach to the technology. Co-founder Jason Glassberg of Casaba Security in Redmond, Washington, an expert on new and emerging threats posed by AI, handicapped the meeting as a get-to-know-you that will likely yield few concrete results, but get the two sides talking. \u201cWhat\u2019s most important right now is that both sides realize they each have a lot to lose if AI becomes weaponized or abused,\u201d Glassberg said in an e-mail. \u201cAll parties involved are equally at risk. Right now, one of the biggest areas of risk is with deepfakes, particularly for use in disinformation campaigns.\u201d Related Stories As Guatemalan kids sit in planes on tarmac, judge orders they stay in the US, for now Government shutdown looms as Congress returns after monthlong August recess Lebanon\u2019s speaker calls for national dialogue on Hezbollah\u2019s weapons, criticizes US pressure \u201cThis is just as big of a risk for the PRC as it is for the U.S. government,\u201d he added, referring to the People\u2019s Republic of China. \u25c6 Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. \u201cIt\u2019s vitally important that the United States and China begin frank discussions about how to improve AI safety,\u201d said Paul Scharre, an AI expert at the Center for New American Security think tank. \u201cThe stakes are high and the consequences for AI-related accidents could be severe. \u201c He noted that the United States pledged in 2022 to always maintain a human in the loop for nuclear weapons use. But China\u2019s military has not done the same. \u201cEnsuring strict human control over nuclear weapons seems a low bar to clear for agreement on military AI,\u201d said Scharre, author of \u201cFour Battlegrounds: Power in the Age of Artificial Intelligence.\u201d \u201cAs the world\u2019s leading economic, military, and technological powers, agreement between the United States and China on how to manage AI risks could help set the stage for other nations to follow suit.\u201d It was not immediately clear why the meeting was taking place in Geneva, though the internationally-minded Swiss city bills itself as a hub of diplomacy and U.N. and international institutions. The Geneva-based International Telecommunications Union \u2014 a U.N. agency currently headed by American Doreen Bogdan-Martin and previously run by China\u2019s Houlin Zhao \u2014 is set to host its annual \u201cAI for Good\u201d conference in the city later this month. The meeting is the first under an intergovernmental dialogue on AI agreed upon during a multi-faceted meeting between Xi and Biden in San Francisco six months ago. The U.S. government has sought to set some guardrails around the technology while fostering its growth, seeking a possible boon for economic output and jobs. Western experts have suggested that China\u2019s government, meanwhile, has in part kept a lid on AI applications because of its real or potential applications for military and surveillance activities under the ruling Communist Party. U.S. officials suggested they would lay out ways to mitigate possible risks from the technology by creating voluntary commitments with the sector\u2019s leading companies and requiring safety tests of AI products. ___ AP Technology Writer Frank Bajak in Boston contributed. ___ This story was first published on May 14, 2024.

China and the United States held their first intergovernmental meeting on artificial intelligence (AI) on May 14. The session followed months of preparations between Chinese and U.S. representatives that culminated in a concrete commitment at last November\u2019s Xi-Biden presidential talks during the November 2023 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit . As expected, the meeting did not yield concrete decisions, deliverables, or a joint statement, though both governments expressed satisfaction with an opportunity to exchange views. In line with the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to build \u201cguardrails\u201d against military conflict, U.S. officials termed such AI talks \u201can important part of responsibly managing competition\u201d by helping make the world safer. Nathaniel C. Fick, the first U.S. Ambassador at Large for Cyberspace and Digital Policy, said the AI communication channel \u201cwill allow the United States and China to find areas to collaborate and work together, even as they compete in other areas.\u201d Both governments participated in last year\u2019s inaugural AI Safety Summit in the United Kingdom (which issued the so-called Bletchley Declaration , signed by both China and the United States) and this May\u2019s follow-up summit in Seoul . Secretary of State Anthony Blinken detailed the current U.S. approach toward emerging technologies in a presentation at last month\u2019s RSA Conference in San Francisco, timed with the release of the State Department\u2019s new International Cyberspace and Digital Policy Strategy . According to U.S. officials, the strategy\u2019s \u201cnorth star \u2013 its organizing principle \u2013 is the concept of digital solidarity\u201d among allies, partners, companies, and civil society actors sharing U.S. values. Blinken defined digital solidarity as \u201ca willingness to work together on shared goals\u2026to help partners build capacity to provide mutual support\u2026to collaborate on everything from norms to regulations to technical standards.\u201d U.S. officials argue that this focus on partnerships\u2014also seen in Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin\u2019s speech at the recent Shangri-La defense dialogue\u2014contrasts with authoritarian regimes\u2019 prioritization of \u201cdigital sovereignty.\u201d At the Geneva talks, the PRC representatives sought to reverse tightening U.S. limits on the transfer of advanced technologies to China. The Chinese government perceives the U.S. \u201c small yard, high fence \u201d approach limiting exports of advanced semiconductors having potential military or AI applications as excessively broad and restrictive. They instead proposed consideration of joint China-U.S. AI-related research and development projects. The Chinese government also wants to strengthen the role of the United Nations in governing AI norms and rules, partly to prevent U.S. tech companies or the U.S. government from enjoying decisive influence on the issue. Such a stance, seen in the negotiations regarding a UN declaration on a Global Digital Compact , also aims to appeal to developing countries lacking leading AI firms. Though cooperating in UN bodies, U.S. officials have focused most attention on the G7, where China and Russia are not members. To compete with Beijing for Global South approval, Blinken and other U.S. officials have stressed their affirmative vision for using AI to impart momentum to lagging UN Sustainable Develop ment Goals . In a presentation at the Washington Post headquarters on June 6, Fick said the United States was interested in continuing its dialogue with China. For example, both governments can exchange information about how they are aligning frontier AI systems with human values. Though the U.S. approach currently focuses more on securing \u201cvoluntary commitments\u201d by developers to subject novel technologies to rigorous safety and security reviews, which Flik valued for their flexibility in addressing rapid technological changes, the United States may move closer to the more regulatory approach of PRC authorities. Still, the range and impact of these discussions will remain limited. Beijing has declined to sign the U.S.-authored Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy, which more than 50 other governments support but needs more backing to become an established norm of responsible international behavior. The United States is unlikely to relax national security export and investment controls for U.S. technologies having military application. For the same reason, U.S. officials will continue to resist collaborating on technical development projects and may curtail Chinese access to U.S.-developed closed-source AI models. They also want to prevent foreign actors from exploiting AI technologies to interfere in U.S. elections. Analysts are concerned that AI tools will make such cyber manipulation easier and more effective . For example, AI might make \u201cdeepfakes\u201d of politicians more realistic, enable precision targeting of specially constructed communications to discrete individuals, and make foreign messaging appear more authentic. Furthermore, U.S. officials will continue to raise allegations that China is pre-positioning malware in critical transportation, power, and water infrastructure in the United States and other countries. Timothy D. Haugh, commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, said that Volt Typhoon and other PRC-linked groups sought options to disrupt foreign military intervention in potential military contingencies involving China. Future bilateral talks on AI safety may involve higher-level officials from a broader range of government agencies, including defense departments. It could be beneficial to address AI issues in arms control and risk reduction dialogue between the Chinese and U.S. security communities. The two governments recently agreed to resume direct military talks. Nonetheless, China and the United States are unlikely to negotiate a formal AI treaty anytime soon, while unilateral statements, even if made in parallel by both governments, will confront problems of verifying and enforcing compliance . Establishing an AI Incidents Hotline is of questionable value given problems with past Sino-American crisis communication mechanisms. The most productive talks on AI and military security will likely continue to occur in non-governmental (Track II) dialogues concentrating on practice rather than principles. Past expert exchanges have clarified terminology, reviewed case studies, and, especially valuable, simulated potential AI-related conflict scenarios. Future sessions can profitably encompass academic and industry representatives . One way or another, the two countries will continue engaging with each other on AI issues since they possess the largest AI companies and markets. At the same time, the commercial centrality of AI technology and its inherent dual-use nature ensure that AI issues will remain a source of tension between China and the United States.

It\u2019s hoped that the meetings will lead to further dialogue to ensure the technology is not misused by either party. On 14 May 2024, top officials and envoys from the U.S. and China met in Geneva, Switzerland, to open the first-ever bilateral dialogue between the two nations to ensure that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are not misused or become an existential risk. The talks were initially agreed by Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping when they met on 15 November 2023 at the Filoli Estate near San Francisco. The U.S. and China express concerns about the use of AI While no concrete results were expected, it did present the opportunity for both sides to express their concerns regarding each other\u2019s use of AI. The meeting was led by high-level officials \u2013 who remained anonymous \u2013 from the White House and Departments of State and Commerce. At the same time, U.S. officials hoped that it would provide insight into Beijing\u2019s thinking about AI amid a generally secretive Chinese approach to the technology. \u201cTo be very clear, talks with Beijing are not focused on promoting any form of technical collaboration or cooperating on frontier research in any matter. And our technology protection policies are not up for negotiation,\u201d one official said in a series of statements released by both sides during and after the talks. The U.S. delegation stressed the need to \u201c maintain open lines of communication on AI risk and safety as an important part of responsibly managing competition.\u201d Furthermore, U.S. officials raised concerns about China\u2019s \u201c misuse of AI \u201d , citing China\u2019s rapid proliferation of AI capabilities across civilian, military, and national security sectors, which it feared could undermine the security of the U.S. and its allies. For example, China has built one of the world\u2019s most intrusive digital surveillance systems, which has an AI component with street cameras and the ability to track chat apps and mobile phone use. Banning the use of autonomous nuclear weapon technology But one of the main areas of concern was the use of AI and nuclear weapons \u2013 on 26 April 2023, the U.S. introduced the Block Nuclear Launch by Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Act \u201cTo prohibit the use of Federal funds to launch a nuclear weapon using an autonomous weapons system that is not subject to meaningful human control, and for other purposes.\u201d [1] Washington has pressed China and Russia to do the same, but so far neither has matched the U.S. pledge. Another concern expressed by U.S. officials was the use of deepfake technology that could influence political opinions and spread misinformation campaigns. However, China \u2013 unlike the U.S. \u2013 imposed a comprehensive set of new laws in January 2023 that ban the use of manipulative AI fakery. After a year-long public comment period, the Cyberspace Administration of China implemented what was described as the \u2018first-of-its-kind\u2019 and the \u2018most comprehensive\u2019 law in the world regulating deepfakes. The regulations prohibit the use of deepfake technology for spreading \u2018 fake\u2019 news or information that could disrupt the economy or national security, with Beijing describing it at the time as a mechanism for social stability. China expresses concerns over U.S. restrictions on AI technologies Conversely, Beijing\u2019s representatives took a firm stance against Washington over its \u201crestrictions and pressure\u201d on AI. In August 2023, Biden signed an executive order banning Chinese access to advanced AI semiconductors and U.S. investment in China\u2019s AI sector \u2013 Beijing has lashed out against the order multiple times. China also advocated for the United Nations to take a lead role in the global governance of AI in an attempt to sidestep Washington\u2019s influence over the technology. On 8 May 2024, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers unveiled a bill that would make it easier for Washington to impose export controls on AI models and would give the Commerce Department authority to bar American companies and individuals from working with foreign actors to develop AI systems that might pose a risk to U.S. national security. If passed, the \u201cEnhancing National Frameworks for Overseas Critical Exports Act\u201d (ENFORCE Act) would also prevent future AI export regulations from legal challenges. [2] Pamir considers that both parties are fully aware of the opportunities AI offers, but that it also poses an equal risk to both the U.S. and China. Both parties are aware that everyone has a lot to lose if AI is weaponized or misused, and it is essential that constructive talks between Washington and Beijing are maintained to ensure its prudent use, while ensuring safe competition. But the success of this first round of talks will ultimately be dictated by whether this dialogue continues and that there are further on-going discussions.

The focus of the talks was to explore the risks associated with emerging AI technology and foster investments in AI safety research. The ultimate objective was to establish a scientific pathway for the safe development of more advanced AI technology. Participants emphasized the necessity for international standards on AI safety and alignment, highlighting the importance of agreement among key actors to facilitate broader consensus. These previously undisclosed talks mark a notable instance of Sino-US cooperation in the realm of cutting-edge technologies, especially amid the ongoing competition for supremacy in AI and quantum computing. The Geneva meetings, facilitated by the private mediation organization Shaikh Group, received support from the White House, as well as UK and Chinese government officials, according to an anonymous negotiator present at the discussions. The Chinese embassy in the UK expressed support for efforts to discuss AI governance and cooperation on global AI governance frameworks, norms, and standards. The talks, which included technical cooperation and policy proposals, contributed to discussions at the UN Security Council meeting on AI in July 2023 and the UK\u2019s AI summit in November of the same year. Plans for future discussions are underway, focusing on scientific and technical proposals to align AI systems with legal codes, societal norms, and values. Notably, major Chinese AI companies such as ByteDance, Tencent, and Baidu did not participate, and Google DeepMind, while briefed on the talks, did not attend. Calls for cooperation between leading powers in addressing the challenges and risks associated with AI have been on the rise, with Chinese scientists and Western academics signing a statement in November advocating for tighter controls and international regulations on advanced AI systems. OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and Tsinghua University declined to comment on their participation in the discussions.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab WASHINGTON, May 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. and China will meet in Geneva to discuss artificial intelligence on Tuesday and U.S. officials stressed that Washington's policies would not be up for negotiation as talks explore how to mitigate risks from the emerging technology. President Joe Biden's administration has sought to engage China on a range of issues to reduce miscommunication between the two rivals. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi broached the topic of AI in April in Beijing, where they agreed to hold their first formal bilateral talks on the subject. Sign up here. The State Department has pressed China and Russia to match U.S. declarations that only humans, and never artificial intelligence, would make decisions on deploying nuclear weapons. \"This is the first meeting of its kind. So, we expect to have a discussion of the full range of risks, but wouldn't prejudge any specifics at this point,\" a senior administration official told reporters ahead of the meeting when asked if the U.S. would prioritize the nuclear weapons issue. China's rapid deployment of AI capabilities across civilian, military and national security sectors often undermined the security of the U.S. and its allies, the official said, adding the talks would allow Washington to directly communicate its concerns. \"To be very clear, talks with Beijing are not focused on promoting any form of technical collaboration or cooperating on frontier research in any matter. And our technology protection policies are not up for negotiation,\" the official added. The U.S. delegation will include officials from the White House and State and Commerce Departments, the White House National Security Council (NSC) said on Monday. Reuters has reported that the Biden administration plans to put guardrails on U.S.-developed proprietary AI models that power popular chatbots like ChatGPT to safeguard the technology from countries such as China and Russia. A second U.S. official briefing reporters said Washington and Beijing were competing to shape the rules on AI, but also hoped to explore whether some rules could be \"embraced by all countries.\" \"We certainly don't see eye to eye ... on many AI topics and applications, but we believe that communication on critical AI risks can make the world safer,\" the second official said. NSC official Tarun Chhabra and Seth Center, the State Department's acting special envoy for critical and emerging technology, will lead the talks with officials from China's Foreign Ministry and state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer plans to issue recommendations in coming weeks to address risks from AI, which he says will then be translated into piecemeal legislation. He has cited competition with China and its divergent goals for AI, including surveillance and facial recognition applications, as reason for Washington's need to take a lead in crafting laws around the rapidly advancing technology. Chinese authorities have been emphasizing the need for the country to develop its own \"controllable\" AI technology .
