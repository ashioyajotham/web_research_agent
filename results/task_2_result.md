Trump proposed tariffs of 50-100% on China, claiming it would pressure Russia to end the conflict. US President Donald Trump (R) and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi (R) China has hit back strongly at Donald Trump-led US after Washington called on its Nato allies to impose major sanctions on Beijing -- 50 to 100 per cent -- alleging China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in funding Russia and adding to its lethal potency in the war against Ukraine. In response, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi reiterated that China is committed to promoting peace talks to resolve hot-spot issues, saying \"wars cannot solve problems and sanctions would only complicate them.\" Wang made the remarks at a press conference in Ljubljana on Saturday after his meeting with Slovenia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs, Tanja Fajon, China Daily reported. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do As I Say Or\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u0099: Trump Loses Temper At NATO Nations Buying Russian Oil; Warns Them To Stop\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina does not participate in or plan wars, and what China does is to encourage peace talks and promote political settlement of hotspot issues through dialogue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wang Yi said. The Chinese foreign minister also called for promoting multilateralism, strengthening multilateral mechanisms, and jointly safeguarding the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. He specified that the current international situation is marked by \u00e2\u0080\u009cintertwined chaos and continuous conflicts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina and Europe should be friends rather than rivals, and should cooperate rather than confront each other. Making the right choices amid the greatest changes in a century demonstrates the responsibilities that both sides should fulfill towards history and the people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wang Yi said, as reported by Global Times. His veiled reference came shortly after US President Donald Trump on Saturday proposed that Nato impose tariffs of 50 per cent to 100 per cent on China. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe that this, plus Nato, as a group, placing 50 per cent to 100 per cent TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s renewed tariff threat came on the heels of his recent attempts to mediate and broker peace in the ongoing, intensifying war between Russia and Ukraine. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump shifted his focus to European allies. He signalled that he does not want European nations to continue buying oil from Russia and criticised their sanctions as \"not tough enough.\" He said, \"Europe is buying oil from Russia. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want them to buy oil -- and the sanctions that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re putting on are not tough enough. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m willing to do sanctions, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to toughen up their sanctions commensurate with what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing.\" Previously, Trump had accused Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping of \u00e2\u0080\u009cconspiring against\u00e2\u0080\u009d the United States. The accusation followed China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest-ever military parade held on September 3, which North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin attended. Hours after accusing Chinese President Xi Jinping of \u00e2\u0080\u009cconspiring against\u00e2\u0080\u009d America, Trump said his personal ties with the Chinese leadership were \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Interestingly, this time, Trump left India out of his recent gambit, amid indications that Washington and New Delhi are working towards a separate deal. Earlier, Trump had also targeted India with his tariff rhetoric, already imposing a 50 per cent duty on New Delhi on similar grounds, accusing it of bolstering Russia through its \u00e2\u0080\u009cmassive oil purchase\" from Moscow.
