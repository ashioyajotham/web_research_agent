Atkinson | September 16, 2024 Downloads Full Report PDF Exec Sum PDF More in This Series Capitol Hill Briefing Event There may be no more important question for the West\u2019s competitive position in advanced industries than whether China is becoming a rival innovator. While the evidence suggests it hasn\u2019t yet taken the overall lead, it has pulled ahead in certain areas, and in many others Chinese firms will likely equal or surpass Western firms within a decade or so. KEY TAKEAWAYS China has reached a new stage in its economic development, with much greater innovation capabilities in its universities and domestic companies\u2014and on many innovation indicators, China now leads the United States. China leads or is on par with global leaders in commercial nuclear power and electric vehicles and batteries. It lags behind for now in other key sectors, including robotics, biopharmaceuticals, chemicals, and AI. But it is making rapid progress. The combination of low costs and growing innovation capability make an increasing number of Chinese companies formidable global competitors. This rapid innovation progress stems from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s determined effort to dominate global markets in a host of advanced industries. While the Chinese innovation system is not perfect, it is much stronger than previously understood\u2014and there are many aspects of it the United States should emulate. To enable those policies, America should embrace a \u201cnational power capitalism\u201d suited to the current existential competition. Government must identify key sectors that are critical for national power and invest adequately to win the techno-economic war. To do so, America should create five industrial research institutes, a \u201ccompetitiveness DARPA,\u201d and an industrial development bank; triple the research and experimentation tax credit; and institute a seven-year, 25 percent credit for capital equipment.

If China has difficulty becoming an innovator and remains largely a copier, then the threat to the United States and other allied technology economies is less. In this case, as long as the United States (and allies) can innovate at a robust-enough rate, they can likely maintain the lead on advanced technologies, even if China quickly copies foreign innovations. But if China can develop new-to-the-world innovations ahead of, or at the nearly the same time as, the United States and allied nations, its potential to displace U.S. (and allied) technology-based companies and capabilities becomes much more likely, especially because China benefits from significant economies of scale and a government laser focused on global best-in-class science and technology policy for competitiveness. To date, this issue has been widely discussed, but, with the exception of analysis of a variety of innovation input indicators (e.g., research article citations, research and development (R&D) personnel, patents, etc.), it has not been rigorously examined. To remedy that, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), with the support of the Smith Richardson Foundation, has conducted an analysis of the extent to which Chinese companies are innovating and already possess the capabilities to be global innovation leaders. Overall, we find that, for the most part, while Chinese firms and industries are not as innovative as the global leaders in Western nations (defined as developed, democratic nations), they are catching up, in many cases at an extremely rapid pace\u2014and the scale of their efforts is massive. [1] As the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations wrote somewhat modestly in 2021, \u201cChina still has a not insignificant gap to close with the United States in the fields of science and technology, but the [Chinese] growth rate is rapid and there is potential for development.\u201d [2] To use an analogy, it\u2019s as if we were to look out at the ocean and see calm waves, but over the horizon is a tsunami of hundreds of strong, innovative, and lower-cost Chinese firms in dozens of industries seeking to grab global market share from established leaders. For the most part, while Chinese firms and industries are not as innovative as the global leaders in Western nations, they are catching up, in many cases at an extremely rapid pace\u2014and the scale of their efforts is massive. These research findings suggest that it\u2019s time to reject the often ideologically based view that \u201cChina can\u2019t innovate.\u201d While China is ruled by a communist party, China is not the Soviet Union, and its firms have considerable degrees of freedom to act, as long as they are working to achieve the goal of making China the world innovation leader. The reality is that China is much more akin to where the Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan) were 20 years ago, only in this case, China is not a tiger, but rather a fire-breathing dragon on government-provided steroids. Why This Matters China became the world\u2019s manufacturing workshop on the basis of a combination of low costs, a large and rapidly growing domestic market, and aggressive efforts to recruit foreign manufacturers. While that process led to considerable manufacturing decline in the United States, most of it (with the exception of consumer electronics) was in more traditional industries such as plastics, metals, textiles and apparel, toys, and furniture. [3] While this was hard on the U.S. workers and communities that lost to China, it did not mean a significant weakening of U.S. techno-economic strength and dual-use (civilian and military) capabilities, particularly in U.S.-headquartered firms. And it certainly did not mean a high level of strategic dependency on China. If a conflict came, the worst that could happen would be no more McDonald\u2019s Happy Meal toys. China is much more akin to where the Asian Tigers were 20 years ago, only in this case, China is not a tiger, but rather a fire-breathing dragon on government-provided steroids. However, the last decade has shown that China can be a globally competitive producer of technologically complex goods, such as telecom equipment, machine tools, computers, solar panels, high-speed rail, ships, drones, satellites, heavy equipment, and pharmaceuticals. In all these industries, China has gained significant global market share\u2014and it is making rapid strides in emerging industries such as robotics, AI, quantum computing and biotech. Indeed, as ITIF\u2019s Hamilton Index shows, China\u2019s global share of advanced industries has grown dramatically over the last 25 years. (See figure 1.) Figure 1: China\u2019s global market shares in advanced industries In most of these industries, China has been able to gain market share through the advantages of scale economies in its often-protected home market, combined with significant subsidies to Chinese firms. This is why, in 2020, in 7 of 10 advanced industries, China led in global production, with the United States leading in only 3. (See table 1.) Table 1: Hamilton Index industry leaders, 2020 Industry Global Output (Billions) Leading Producer Leader\u2019s Share IT and Information Services $1,900 USA 36.4% Computers and Electronics $1,317 China 26.8% Chemicals $1,146 China 29.1% Machinery and Equipment $1,135 China 32.0% Motor Vehicles $1,093 China 24.3% Basic Metals $976 China 45.6% Fabricated Metals $846 China 25.6% Pharmaceuticals $696 USA 28.4% Electrical Equipment $602 China 36.1% Other Transportation $386 USA 34.5% Composite Hamilton Index $10,097 China 25.3% On many measures, China already leads the United States and can be considered a co-equal economic superpower. It\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) is more or less equivalent, it has significantly more exports, and its manufacturing sector is vastly larger. But with all that strength, China still lacks two things: high productivity and the ability to outcompete innovative leaders. China\u2019s productivity will no doubt continue to grow faster than the United States\u2019 over the next three decades, probably at least until it gets to about 80 percent of U.S. levels. But that will come about almost entirely through domestic-serving industries (e.g., agriculture, utilities, logistics, business services, retail trade, finance, etc.) using more technology and getting more productive. When that happens, China\u2019s GDP will easily be double if not triple that of the United States. There is little the United States and allies can do to slow China\u2019s productivity growth, because, for the most part, that growth does not depend on any chokepoint technologies controlled by allied nations. Moreover, that growth could have some benefits for the United States and allied advanced industries not only by boosting Chinese demand but also by creating a vast Chinese middle class that may seek more democratic rights, as was the case in countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. It is China\u2019s progress on innovation that poses the more-significant challenge to the United States and its democratic allies. To date, much of China\u2019s growth has come from copying the leaders and producing products that, while not as high quality, are priced more competitively. This has helped China gain market share, particularly in less-developed countries where price is a more important differentiating factor. This is one reason why China has taken almost all the growth in these industries from nations outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). (See figure 2.) Figure 2: Non-OECD change in global market shares (percentage-point difference, 1995\u20132020) However, going forward, if China can combine its cost advantage with an innovation advantage, or at least innovation parity, the challenge to innovative industries in Western nations will become much more significant. As such, a key question for these nations is to what extent China has become or will soon become an innovation leader, or at least on par with innovation leaders. If China can become an innovation leader, that development poses a significant threat to Western nations and their firms because China will be able to combine quality, innovation, and price. This is a key reason why the threat from an innovative China is so significant. Historically, low- and middle-income countries were generally not innovators, and they competed either in more routine, older industries (e.g., textiles, commodity metal products, low-end electronics, assembly of goods, etc.) or in advanced industries by copying and being a generation or two behind the leaders and competing on lower-cost labor. And in this latter case, this was almost always through branch plant operations of firms in higher-income nations. As such, the knowledge diffusion to the host country was somewhat limited, and its domestic capabilities for competitiveness grew slowly, usually at around the same pace as the leaders. In this sense, there was a global division of labor, with high-income nations (e.g., the United States, Commonwealth nations, the European Union, and, more recently, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan) specializing in industries and products that other countries did not have the technical capabilities to make. [4] This was one reason why they could sustain their cost disadvantage. But if China can compete across the board in an array of complex industries and produce new-to-the-world products, while also enjoying a significant cost advantage (Chinese labor costs around 25 to 30 percent of U.S. costs), that will be a major competitive threat to leading global innovation-based companies, and the economies that host them. And without these companies producing in the United States and other advanced economies, these nations\u2019 techno-economic power will decline relatively, as there is simply no way for domestic (and often smaller) firms to take up the slack when multinationals lose significant market share. If China can compete in an array of complex industries, while also enjoying a significant cost advantage, that will be a major competitive threat to leading global innovation-based companies, and the economies that host them. China achieving innovation parity would have two major effects, one in China, and one in Western nations. First, it would mean that China would be much more self-sufficient in advanced industries and much less vulnerable to Western sanctions and other trade tools used in an attempt to discipline China. At the same time, it would also boost Chinese military capabilities even more, as civil-military fusion becomes stronger, and weapons systems companies could rely on cutting-edge technologies across a range of industries. Just as importantly, this commercial technology strength would also equate to increased power in foreign affairs, just as America dominated the globe for more than a half century after WWII, as its firms were the unalloyed leaders. It is China that might decide to impose export controls on the allied nations as punishment. The Fisher Body Plant in Detroit, Michigan, manufactured automobiles from 1919 to 1984. [5] It is these foreign effects, particular on the United States (and other Western nations) that are potentially most important. If China can become an innovative leader in robotics, electric vehicles (EVs), airplanes, semiconductors, drugs, and more, it can dominate the global economy. If China makes serious inroads into the market share of current technology leaders (e.g., ABB in robotics, GM in cars, Boeing in airplanes, Intel in chips, Merck in drugs, etc.), the fundamental nature of the global economy shifts. The 200 year-long development of advanced industry in capitalist, democratic nations\u2014first in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, and then in America, and then Japan, South Korea and Taiwan joining the \u201cclub\u201d\u2014could radically change. The West could very well become what Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and parts of Europe (e.g.. Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) have already become: largely hollowed-out economies with little advanced manufacturing, a weak technology sector, and an economy propped up by tourism, finance, agriculture, and natural resources. [6] This is the trend for the United States as the U.S. location quotient (the industry output as a share of the U.S. economy over the industry output as a share of the global economy) has fallen. (See figure 3.) With any kind of foresight, it\u2019s easy to see the same fate befalling the United States if China can be an innovation peer. Figure 3: America\u2019s relative historical performance in Hamilton Index industries (LQ trends) It is impossible to overstate the implications of this potential development, as it would entail a massive switch in the center of global economic power and innovation from a geopoint somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean to somewhere in China. To be sure, just as the United Kingdom still has some tech capabilities and firms after its half century of industrial decline, the allied nations will not completely become, as Alexander Hamilton warned, a hewer of water and drawer of wood, dependent on the innovation leader of the time, the United Kingdom. But if China can move to the frontier of global innovation\u2014a destination all forces in China are pulling toward\u2014the world economy and relative national power will be fundamentally transformed. The Nature of Innovation Industries and Competitive Positioning Such a change could be gradual, but if it happens, it would more likely be quite sudden (i.e., within a decade or two). The reason is because of the unique nature of innovation industries. These almost always have high fixed costs (e.g., R&D, product design, tooling setup) and lower marginal costs, where losing sales can lead to a death spiral of less revenue, less investment, and less innovation and then less revenue. The opposite is true for firms that are gaining revenue. Chinese innovation scholar Yin Li noted that \u201cbuilding these organizational capabilities inevitably entails high fixed costs that, for innovation to be successful, must be transformed into low unit costs, through accessing a large share of the market.\u201d [7] If China can move to the frontier of global innovation\u2014a destination all forces in China are pulling toward\u2014the world economy and relative national power will be fundamentally transformed. Figure 4 illustrates the cost structure of a hypothetical firm for which fixed costs are 40 times marginal costs\u2014$400,000 and $10,000, respectively. In other words, the company must spend $400,000 on R&D, design, machinery, and other fixed costs before it can produce its first unit. It then costs $10,000 to make each unit in terms of energy, materials, and labor, and the company can sell them for $14,450 per unit. Because of its high fixed costs, the company loses money until it sells at least 88 units. At that point, it makes an increasing profit on each additional unit sold. Figure 4: Hypothetical firm with fixed costs 40 times greater than marginal costs For these industries, scale is everything. Imagine if, because of tougher, subsidized competition from China, sales of the U.S. firm go down to 75 units. In this case, the company would suffer a loss of $62,500. But if it faces less competition from China, then the company could earn a profit of $50,000 after selling 100 units. Meanwhile, whereas the total cost for producing the 75th chip would be $15,333, the total cost for producing the 100th chip would drop to $14,000. Now imagine the company needs to invest 20 percent of its revenues in new R&D to remain competitive. That moves the goalpost; it would require selling more than 250 units to become profitable. This is why scale is so critical for advanced industries, and why a threat from a robust competitor can be so devastating so fast. Profits fall fast, so R&D and other core value creation capabilities are cut. As a result, the next generation of sales fall, and the downward cycle continues. We have seen this with a number of North American companies facing the China challenge (e.g., Lucent and Nortel) and industries (the U.S. solar panel industry), which fell from dominance astoundingly fast. If China can be an innovative leader and take market share from Western leaders, the latter\u2019s ability to keep investing in innovation falls, as do future sales. The increased sales accruing to Chinese firms enables them to gain even more scale, allowing them to sell products for even lower prices and achieve higher profits (or lower levels of government-subsidized losses) to invest in next-generation products. Some will respond that this exaggerates the threat and paints innovation as a zero-sum game. To be sure, if China develops a cure for cancer (or workable nuclear fusion, etc.) the world and America would benefit. But at the same time, it would mean reduced global market share from U.S. and Western-based drug companies. This is because the market for advanced industry goods is largely fixed as a share of global GDP. As figure 5 shows, 10 advanced industries accounted for 11.9 percent of global value-added output in 1995 and 11.8 percent in 2020. To the extent China captures more of the global sales in these industries, that by definition leads to less market share for non-Chinese firms, and potentially fewer actual sales. Figure 5: Hamilton industry shares of the global economy We have already seen such win-lose shifts. ITIF has identified the industries and countries where there was the most nominal decline in output from 2017 to 2020, not counting motor vehicles, which overall saw declines: \u25aa In Austria and Switzerland, the biggest declines were in electrical equipment (declines of $1.15 billion and $115 million, respectively). During this period, China expanded its output by $42 billion. \u25aa The nations where the largest loss was in machinery and equipment were Germany ($16.4 billion), Japan ($14 billion), Italy ($5.0 billion), Brazil ($4.1 billion), Argentina ($1.8 billion), Mexico ($1.5 billion), and the United Kingdom ($1.8 billion). China expanded its output by $69.4 billion. \u25aa In computers and electronics, Denmark\u2019s output fell $80 million, Japan\u2019s fell $6.5 billion, and South Korea\u2019s fell $18 billion. China\u2019s output increased by $64.7 billion. \u25aa In chemicals, Brazil\u2019s output fell by $8.7 billion, Canada $900 million, Netherlands $1.4 billion, Norway $400 million, Pakistan $600 million, Singapore $5 billion, South Korea $5.6 billion, Germany $5.4 billion, and France $3.8 billion. China\u2019s output increased $35.5 billion. \u25aa In basic metals, Japan\u2019s output fell $17.2 billion and Turkey\u2019s $5.3 billion, while China\u2019s increased $86.4 billion. \u25aa In fabricated metals, Germany\u2019s output fell by $7.1 billion, South Korea\u2019s output fell by $4 billion, France\u2019s by $3.4 billion, and Spain and Sweden $1.2 billion, while China\u2019s increased $41.8 billion. It\u2019s time to move away from the focus on manufacturing per se and focus instead on advanced industry leadership. Finally, it is important to clarify that this is not about manufacturing per se. Much of the competitiveness debate in the United State is fixated on manufacturing. The free-market globalists go to great pains to distort the data to show that U.S. manufacturing is healthy (or irrelevant) because they fear that acknowledgement of the truth could lead to an abandonment of their global idealist vision of the world as one large integrated price-mediated market. In contrast, the emerging worker nationalists stress manufacturing jobs\u2014low-tech or high-tech\u2014in part because of their solidarity with labor over capital. But the United States could have a robust manufacturing economy based around low value-added industries (e.g., textiles, metal parts, food products) and still be dependent on China for advanced industries and innovation. As such, it\u2019s time to move away from the focus on manufacturing per se and focus instead on advanced industry leadership. That matters not only for national power writ large\u2014and for holding adversaries in check while increasing their dependence on the United States\u2014but also, critically, for defense capabilities, particularly should the United States be forced into a long and protracted war. As retired U.S. Army Major General John G. Ferrari recently stated, he had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about America\u2019s ongoing reliance on China to equip its military and said, \u201cIf we were in a war with China and it stopped providing parts, we wouldn\u2019t be able to build the planes and weapons we needed.\u201d [8] What Is Innovation? One reason why it has been difficult to answer the question, \u201cHow innovative is China?\u201d is that there are multiple definitions of what it means for an economy to be \u201cinnovative.\u201d Some equate it with doing well in innovation-based industries, even if that output is largely based on copying from leaders in other nations. Others argue it is strong performance in a variety of innovation metrics, such as patents, R&D, and venture capital (VC), even though these metrics are correlated with innovation but are not determinative. Still others argue that it is a nation\u2019s firms gaining market share in first-to-the-world (or near-first-to-the-world) products and services. For the purposes of this report, it is this third definition that is most relevant because it is key to determining whether China can do more than copy and because even strong innovation metrics are not necessarily a sign of true innovation performance. Another factor that can complicate the analysis is whether process or product innovation is the measure. Process innovation\u2014developing and adopting new ways of producing a good or service\u2014is an important factor in increasing labor productivity (e.g., output per labor hour), and that is key to being able to effectively compete with low-wage economies. Product innovation refers to new and better products (and services). It enables higher-wage economies to compete on the basis of goods that do not compete largely on costs. For example, new pharmaceuticals can be priced higher than older generics if they provide better treatment. New 5-nanometer (nm) computer chips cost more than older 20 nm chips, but because of superior performance will often outcompete the older generations. Patent protection, trade secrets, and other knowledge advantages can provide somewhat sustainable advantages over lower-cost rivals. However, product innovation is not very important if the innovation cannot be brought to market successfully. This requires adequate quality, a competitive cost structure, and a viable business model. As Clay Christensen pointed out in The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma , it\u2019s not enough to be successful in generating new ideas. [9] Even technological breakthroughs can become a dead end unless they can be translated into working products that are able to be delivered and deployed into the larger marketplace. What we really want to determine is China\u2019s innovative capabilities as they relate to being early in bringing new products to widespread market adoption. Finally, at one end are innovations that are transformative. The invention of nylon, the television, the first transistor, radar, and the personal computer are in this category. At another end are ideas that many other companies are already executing. This is why one factor in innovation is differentiating between breakthrough (sometimes termed exceptional, radical, or disruptive) innovations (e.g., the iPhone) and sustaining innovations (sometimes called incremental or continuous), such as a new generation of semiconductors that has higher performance than the current generation. [10] For example, consider the drivetrain of cars. The development by Tesla of the electric drivetrain was a breakthrough innovation. The development of a better electric motor that uses a small percentage less electricity is an incremental innovation, or what is termed sustaining innovation. Most innovation is sustaining, as companies seek to improve capabilities in existing markets and where they have a clear idea of what problems need to be solved. Disruptive innovations such as the iPhone are relatively rare and often usually relatively quickly enter into a stage of incremental innovation (e.g., better battery life, better displays, better cameras). Disruptive innovation is perhaps the most threatening to companies. Blackberry did not go out of business because the iPhone was a similar phone with a better physical keyboard; it went out of business because the iPhone and the business model that went along with it (including the app store) was disruptive. The milk glass bottle industry did not go out of business because someone made slightly lighter glass bottles; it went out of business because paperboard cartons and then plastic bottles provided much better value. In summary, innovation is not invention. It is not science. It is not necessarily entrepreneurship. It is bringing to market new products or services at scale. In addition, while that part of innovation is critical, so is its widespread diffusion and adoption, and so is the process of technology innovation. Innovation is not invention. It is not science. It is not necessarily entrepreneurship. It is bringing to market new products or services at scale. The Asian Tiger Path One reason to be on the affirmative side of \u201ccan China innovate?\u201d is that it is attempting to follow well-worn paths other developing Asian economies have followed to become innovation leaders. As Linsu Kim wrote in his definitive 1997 history of South Korean innovation upgrading, Imitation to Innovation: The Dynamics of Korea\u2019s Technological Learning , there are several distinct stages a nation that is catching up to the leaders in innovation usually takes. The first involves the transfer of foreign technology to that nation\u2014sometimes by foreign direct investment (FDI), sometimes by licensing, and often, as in the case of China, by theft or pressure on foreign firms seeking to sell in the market. The second stage involves \u201cthe effective diffusion of imported technology within an industry and across industries\u201d which \u201cis a second sequence in upgrading technological capability of an economy.\u201d [11] The third stage \u201cinvolves local efforts to assimilate, adapt, and improve imported technology and eventually to develop one\u2019s own technology. These efforts are crucial to augmenting technology transfer and expediting the acquisition of technological capability. Technology may be transferred to a firm from abroad or through local diffusion, but the ability to use it effectively might not be there. This ability can only be acquired through indigenous technological effort.\u201d [12] The final stage is to become a global innovation leader. As Kim wrote: Firms in catching-up countries that have successfully acquired, assimilated, and sometimes improved mature foreign technologies may aim to repeat the process with higher-level technologies in the transition stage in advanced countries. Many industries in the first tier of catching-up countries (e.g., Taiwan and [South] Korea) have arrived at this stage. If successful, they may eventually accumulate indigenous technological capability to generate emerging technologies in the fluid stage and challenge firms in the advanced countries. [13] China is following this recipe/path, with its first step being to attract foreign investment. In the early 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping opened up the Chinese economy to foreign investment, his main economic development strategy sought principally to induce foreign multinationals to shift relatively low- and moderate-value production to China. [14] China\u2019s second step was to attempt to learn from foreign companies, in part by having them train Chinese executives, scientists, and engineers, and also by forced technology transfer, including through joint ventures. In 2015, 6,000 new international joint ventures, amounting to $27.8 billion in FDI inflows, were established in China. [15] And the sophistication and value of the technology the Chinese government has demanded is high. As the United States Trade Representative\u2019s (USTR\u2019s) Office pointed out in its 2018 Special 301 report on China, pressures on U.S. companies to form joint ventures and transfer technology \u201cis particularly intense.\u201d [16] The third step was to support Chinese companies in their efforts to copy and incorporate foreign technology while building up domestic capabilities. One important marker for the transition from stage two to stage three was the publication in 2006 of the \u201cNational Medium- and Long-term Program for Science and Technology Development (2006\u20132020),\u201d which called on China to master 402 core technologies\u2014everything from intelligent automobiles to integrated circuits and high-performance computers. China moved to a \u201cChina Inc.\u201d development model of indigenous innovation, which focused on helping Chinese firms, especially those in advanced, innovation-based industries, often at the expense of foreign firms. The fourth and final step is to enable Chinese firms to become independent innovators\u2014as Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan have all become. China is attempting to do this through an array of plans and policies: \u201c13th Five-Year Plan for Science and Technology,\u201d \u201c13th Five-Year Plan for National Informatization,\u201d \u201cThe National Cybersecurity Strategy,\u201d and \u201cMade in China 2025 Strategy,\u201d and most recently Xi Jinping\u2019s call at the 20th Party Congress for \u201cinvigorating China through science and education ... for the strategy of innovation-driven development .\u201d [17] The last part of this is to then support these companies \u201cgoing out\u201d and taking market share in other parts of the world. Unfortunately, for gaining political support for a robust U.S. strategy to respond to China, the United States is among the last places Chinese firms will seek to enter. Rather, they are going after market share in places such as Latin America, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe, the \u201csoft underbelly\u201d of global markets. As their firms gain market share, Western\u2014including U.S.\u2014firms, lose market share, and tipping points can happen quite quickly. Finally, it\u2019s important to note that there are two key factors for innovation success. One is talent, and the other is revenue. More money makes innovation vastly easier. Companies with more money can invest more in R&D. They can acquire talent and technology. They can pay their talent more. And they can achieve scale. This is one of the main differences between the Asian Tigers and China: The Chinese market, and hence revenue, is vastly larger. Because China manages its market and limits foreign sales once its firms get to a certain scale, Chinese firms are blessed with massive, largely secure market revenues, and this does not take into account massive government subsidies. Related to this is the massive efforts the Chinese government makes to ensure that Chinese society is a lead adopter of advanced and emerging technologies, including high-speed rail, digital and 5G-enabled manufacturing, robotics, smart cities, smart ports, EVs and autonomous vehicles (AVs), digital payments, healthtech, edtech, drones, satellites and space travel, and many more. [18] While China walks the talk when it comes to transforming its society through technology, and in the process creates massive capabilities and revenues for its technology companies, the United States doesn\u2019t even slow-walk the talk, as all too often we are walking backward, banning and demonizing technology. [19] Transitioning from \u201cfast follower\u201d to \u201cglobal leader\u201d in innovation is not easy, but a number of nations have done it. The United States accomplished this in the early part of the 1900s. Germany and Austria advanced from copying economies in the late 19th century to innovators, building on imports of skilled workers, advanced machinery and blueprints. [20] Japan achieved this by the 1980s, with South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore doing so two to three decades later. The idea that copiers and followers cannot transition into innovation leaders is just not borne out by history. China is not there yet, at least in many sectors, as this report documents. But that is not for lack of trying and having the same kinds of conditions that other innovation transition economies have had. The core insight needed to understand the Chinese economic strategy is as follows. China attaining global competitive advantage in virtually all advanced manufacturing industries requires significant \u201clearning,\u201d as the production \u201crecipes\u201d to make, for example, a wide-body jet, a computer chip, a genomics sequencer, a robot, or a biotech drug are incredibly complex and cannot be obtained from scholarly journal articles or other widely available sources of technical knowledge. Because China manages its market and limits foreign sales once its firms get to a certain scale, Chinese firms are blessed with massive, largely secure market revenues\u2014and this does not take into account massive government subsidies. Even after China has gained global market share in a number of extremely complex, advanced technology industries such as jet aircraft, high-speed rail, solar panels, personal computers, supercomputers, telecommunications equipment, and Internet services, many will still dismiss China\u2019s capabilities and assume China will be incapable of even partial success becoming a true innovator. While mastery of some particularly complex technologies such as semiconductor logic circuits remains a challenge for China, Chinese companies have made significant progress in an array of other technologies, including in certain kinds of semiconductors (e.g., chips for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices). Moreover, the fact that nations such as Japan in the 1960s and 1970s, and Taiwan and South Korea in the 1980s and 1990s, could rapidly progress to become advanced technology economies using similar kinds of approaches (obtaining foreign technology and subsidizing and protecting domestic innovators until they are strong enough to compete on their own), suggests there is nothing inherently keeping China from making similar progress, especially given the massive amount of government support for the effort. [21] One way to understand Chinese innovation is provided by the McKinsey Global Institute\u2019s The China Effect on Global Innovation , which separates innovations into four categories: efficiency-driven, customer-focused, engineering-based, and science-based. [22] The report concludes that with its proven ability to produce goods at scale, adapt products to the Chinese market, and develop and adopt digital infrastructures such as mobile payment systems and e-commerce (sometimes even before more-developed economies), China has demonstrated that it is capable of efficiency-driven and customer-focused innovations. The challenge before it, the authors argued, is to catch up in the areas of engineering- and science-based innovations. Can China innovate? As far as can be determined, there have been no thorough studies of China\u2019s innovation capabilities. There have been a host of studies, including from ITIF, that examine indicators of innovation, such as R&D spending, scientists and engineers, and patenting. [23] But these do not adequately answer the question of whether China is copying or innovating. The question of whether China can innovate is a longstanding one, with analysts coming down on both sides. Some argue that China cannot really be innovative because its innovation system is deficient. This includes charges of weak intellectual property (IP) protection, it being too state directed, and having too little creativity due to rote learning and a hierarchical education system. Others argue that China can\u2019t be innovative because its economy suffers from low productivity, even though the two factors are related but not codeterminant. [24] Still others embrace the popular narrative that we have reached \u201cpeak China\u201d and it\u2019s entering into a long, slow phase of decline. Indeed, the conventional wisdom until recently was that China could not innovate; at best, it could be a fast follower. However, a growing number of analysts have challenged that conventional wisdom, with some arguing that, in certain cases, China is even more innovative than the United States, as exemplified by a 2021 Harvard Business Review article \u201cChina\u2019s New Innovation Advantage.\u201d [25] However, this article relies on metrics such as speed of attaining unicorn status. And with the largest population on earth, one would expect a fair number of Chinese unicorns. The authors also talked about how Chinese people like to adopt new technologies. But there is little evidence that this is greater than some other nations, including the United States. Finally, most of the examples given of Chinese innovation success are in a few narrow areas such as 5G (where China\u2019s lead is actually much less than most people think), mobile payments, and smart scooters (technologies that are not as important to national power). [26] China Cannot Innovate For the most part, scholars studying the Chinese economy broadly, and their innovation capabilities specifically, have until recently largely argued that China is incapable of \u201ctrue\u201d innovation, at least at the global frontier. In general, the reasons given in support of this view are an education system that encourages rote memorization and represses creative expression, a risk-averse culture centered around a reverence for authority that is not conducive to disruption or drastic change, weak IP protections, and inefficient state involvement in markets. Proponents of these arguments believe that while China\u2019s economic rise is impressive, it is bound to be at best a copier of innovations from the West, at least for the foreseeable future. Examples of such arguments abound. In a 2014 article for The Diplomat , Kings College London Professor of Chinese Studies Kerry Brown wrote: The Chinese government under Xi can pour all the money they want into vast research and development parks, churning out any number of world class engineers and computer programmers. Even with all of this effort, however, China is likely to produce few world-class innovative companies. The fundamental structural problem is that the role of the state and government in China is still very strong \u2026 The system that China currently has still rewards conformity. [27] Likewise, a 2014 Harvard Business Review article titled \u201cWhy China Can\u2019t Innovate\u201d lists several reasons that explain why \u201cChina is largely a land of rule-bound rote learners\u2014a place where R&D is diligently pursued but breakthroughs are rare.\u201d [28] It cites the \u201cunprecedented scale of [the Chinese government\u2019s] failure to protect intellectual property rights.\u201d The article also points out that Chinese schools emphasize test scores too heavily and do not prime students to be creative and design oriented. It goes on to note: The Communist Party requires a representative to be present in every company with more than 50 employees. Every firm with more than 100 employees must have a party cell whose leader reports directly to the party in the municipality or province. These requirements compromise the proprietary nature of a firm\u2019s strategic direction, operations, and competitive advantage, thus constraining normal competitive behavior, not to mention the incentives that drive founders to grow their own businesses. [29] It further states that \u201cthe freedom to pursue ideas wherever they may lead is a precondition for innovation in universities.\u201d Likewise, a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed also titled \u201cWhy China Can\u2019t Innovate\u201d lays the blame on the assertion that \u201ccommunism is incapable of nurturing the curiosity that leads to innovation.\u201d [30] Others argue, with some justification, that input metrics such as research articles or even patents fail to effectively measure innovation. But then they go on to suggest that China therefore is not leading. A Defense News article argues that in America\u2019s \u201cthriving open market, a product of the U.S.\u2019s commitment to an open society and the free exchange of ideas, metrics like commercial success, technology adoption and real-world impact become more telling than raw measures.\u201d [31] Yet, the author failed to report any of these better metrics. He went on to note, with no real evidence, \u201cThe U.S. strives, though imperfectly , to offer opportunities to everyone who desires them, eschewing artificial barriers and quotas and avoiding intellectual conformity. This commitment fuels a dynamic, diverse workforce that is a wellspring of ingenuity and innovation.\u201d [32] In this same vein, an Atlantic Council report states, \u201cChina\u2019s authoritarian top down political system poses the risk of restraining free thinking and sharing of ideas and information\u2014both domestically and internationally\u2014that are crucial in stimulating scientific research and discoveries.\u201d [33] A recent article in Foreign Affairs just states it bluntly in the subtitle: \u201cA Statist Economy Can\u2019t Foster Creativity.\u201d [34] The author went on to write that \u201can innovation-based industrial strategy may not be transformative if the government is unable to address basic systemic weaknesses such as youth unemployment, frailties in China\u2019s banking and financial systems, and weak consumer demand.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how any of these relate to innovation, or are even true. Yasheng Huang argued in the Rise and Fall of the EAST that China\u2019s repression, especially under Xi, is deeply problematic for Chinese innovation. [35] Simon Gao wrote that \u201cthere is a bigger reason that China\u2019s ambitious technology endeavors are failing: Its communist system stifles innovation.\u2026 If China can\u2019t cultivate free thinkers, it will always be a follower and never a leader as the West imagines and invents the future.\u201d [36] Others see China as a \u201cpeaking power,\u201d implying that it will continue to lag behind in innovation. [37] Likewise, a Washington Post series featuring experts reflects the new preferred wisdom that China faces a demographic crisis: Its young people are discontent and its economy has hit the wall, in part because of the current banking and real estate challenges; and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is only interested in its own power, not innovation. [38] Studies criticizing China for a rote education system appear to overstate the case. For example, in China as an Innovation Nation , Zhou, Lazonick, and Sun argued that claims criticizing the Chinese education system for suppressing creativity are overblown because similar critiques exist of Japan and South Korea, though most regard both to be innovative nations. [39] At times, this view is similar to the view held in the 1960s and 1970s that Japan\u2019s postwar economic miracle would never overtake the United States because the Japanese were an \u201cimitative people\u201d who were only capable of creating copies of goods the United States and the West developed (e.g. computers, TVs, automobiles, etc.), which proved disastrously wrong. How many governments in the world have decided they\u2019re going to become major innovation centers? None of them have succeeded. Unless you count Finland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Michael Pettis, a professor at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, bluntly stated, \u201cThis is not a country we can expect major innovations from. In the West we don\u2019t have enough confidence about this. How many governments in the world have decided they\u2019re going to become major innovation centers? None of them have succeeded.\u201d [40] Unless you count Finland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. They all committed to becoming innovation centers, and they all succeeded. [41] Pettis went on to say that China is doomed to stagnate, like he\u2019s claimed Japan did, even if it has the best supply-side technology development policies, because of demand-side stagnation, which he\u2019s said Japan suffered. [42] First, Japan had no demand-side stagnation, given that its unemployment rate from 1995 to the present was quite low. [43] Second, Chinese firms don\u2019t rely just on the Chinese market (the same way Japanese firms didn\u2019t); they rely on the growing global market. Scott Kennedy of CSIS is also skeptical of China\u2019s ability to turn willpower and resource allocation into innovation. Citing the lack of growth in China\u2019s output score relative to its input score in the World Intellectual Property Organization\u2019s (WIPO\u2019s) Global Innovation Index between 2009 and 2016, Kennedy dubbed China a \u201cfat tech dragon,\u201d since its apparent inability to turn inputs into outputs is analogous to a low metabolism. [44] Kennedy also pointed out that, while plentiful, Chinese patents are of relatively little practical use. Licensing revenues from the use of patents are still minuscule, and the surge in patents filed is a response to government rather than market incentives. Despite these issues, Kennedy acknowledged that China now graduates more scientists and engineers from its universities than does any other country, a higher percentage of bank loans are going to private businesses rather than state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and IP protections are steadily expanding. [45] Nevertheless, Kennedy has argued, innovation appears to be a secondary goal to market expansion overseen by the state. Others argue that China cannot be innovative because its productivity performance lags behind global leaders. In an article for Australia\u2019s Lowy Institute, John West argued that notwithstanding the relatively high rank on global innovation for a number of Chinese companies, overall, China is not innovative because it is not highly productive. [46] But this wrongly equates innovativeness with productivity. China could in fact have highly innovative globally traded companies and still have low productivity, especially if its nontraded sectors lag behind in productivity. This describes Japan to this day, where its leading traded sector industries (e.g., electronics, autos, etc.) are highly productive and innovative, but its nontraded sectors (e.g., healthcare, retail, etc.) are generally not. Still others now advance the narrative that China\u2019s economic slowdown means that it is in the Japan phase of development and the threat has passed. For example, Council on Foreign Relations scholar Zongyuan Zoe Liu has argued that China has been \u201ckilled\u201d by failed CCP policies. [47] One might say that the most important kind of freedom for innovation is the ability to do innovation with generous funding, something that is much easier for Chinese scientists than for Americans, especially given the declining federal funding for R&D. Finally, it\u2019s important to understand the \u201cfreedom\u201d argument that democratic freedom is essential to national innovation. China is not the Soviet Union, where Lysenkoism (the rejection of traditional Darwinian genetics because it did not fit with Soviet ideology) reigned supreme. It is not even the United States, where stem cell research using discarded embryos was banned for religious reasons. It is a place that gives its scientists and engineers enormous freedom to innovate, as long as it is in areas seen as in the public interest (as opposed to, for example, education apps that lead to an arms race among parents of one-upmanship) or does not criticize or get ahead of the CCP. Indeed, one might say that the most important kind of freedom for innovation is the ability to do innovation with generous funding, something that is much easier for Chinese scientists than for Americans, especially given the declining federal funding for R&D. China Can Innovate More recently, some assessments have argued that China can innovate\u2014if not across the board, then at least in some select key technologies. For example, WIPO\u2019s 2022 Global Innovation Index ranks China 11th most innovative in the world and states, \u201cChina stands out for producing innovations that are comparable to those of the high-income group.\u201d [48] A recent article by IMD Professor Georges Haour tells us, \u201cWhy China is on the way to being a global innovator.\u201d [49] Others have argued that China may be an innovation leader in certain new technology areas, such as quantum computing, fusion, and AI. [50] For example, in the article \u201c Why China will win the global race for complete AI dominance,\u201d the author stated that Kai-Fu Lee believes: We\u2019re in the age of implementation, we\u2019re in the age of data, and China has a better set, a larger set of implementers or good AI engineers who get the work done, who make the algorithms run fast, connect to business logic. The West needs to revise its view of Chinese technology companies being copycats of western products, and acknowledge that, in fact, some categories of Chinese technology are best-in-class. [51] The biggest danger for Silicon Valley, according to Lee, lies in \u201csolipsism and complacency in its own supremacy.\u201d Lee also pointed out that China suffers much less from incumbents using their political power to prevent the adoption of new technologies. He also could have just as easily said that \u201cneo-Luddite\u201d forces in China resisting new technologies, such as AI, facial recognition, automation, and other disruptive technologies, are much less than in the United States, and to the extent they exist in China are suppressed by the state. Likewise, a 2021 report from Harvard\u2019s Belfer Center, \u201cThe Great Tech Rivalry: China vs the U.S.,\u201d argues that China has become a serious competitor in the foundational technologies of the 21st century: AI, 5G, quantum information science (QIS), semiconductors, biotechnology, and green energy. The report notes, \u201cIn some races, it has already become No. 1. In others, on current trajectories, it will overtake the U.S. within the next decade.\u201d [52] It attributes this to a strong R&D ecosystem as well as the top-performing Chinese universities that continue to improve. China technology expert Dan Wang has argued: China\u2019s technological development is considerably more dynamic than the country\u2019s image suggests. China remains behind in several critical areas, and some of its most important tech firms face regulatory squeezes\u2014whether from Washington or Beijing itself. Regardless of these challenges, Chinese industries are reaching world-class standards, and the country\u2019s science is steadily advancing. Along the way, Chinese firms have begun to make significant innovations of their own, including in strategic areas that the United States has prioritized. [53] Tim Ruhlig argued that China is innovative and that the role of the CCP has been a plus, not a negative: \u201cAlthough widely thought to hamper innovation, the role of the party-state should be considered the Fourth Virtue that has made China innovative. It is certainly true that central planning is an obstacle to creativity and thereby to innovation.\u201d [54] Matt Sheen, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argued that China is an \u201cinnovation powerhouse\u201d because of its \u201clarge, semi-protected market; ties with researchers and companies around the world; and waves of financial, human, and physical capital invested in promising fields like AI,\u201d all factors promoted by the government. [55] There are also structural factors that suggest that China could emerge as a global innovation leader. Huang and Sharif argued that three factors will play a key role in making China a technology leader: China\u2019s large market (which lets innovative firms drive down marginal costs faster than others), the centralized system of government that enables China to provide significant support to innovative firms, and China\u2019s strong role in international markets to acquire advanced technologies while increasing its capacity to undertake advanced R&D, often in partnership with foreign interests seeking access to the Chinese market. They argued that these three factors will make China the global technology leader \u201cover the long term.\u201d [56] A Harvard Belfer Institute study argues that \u201cChina\u2019s whole-of-society approach is challenging America\u2019s traditional advantages in the macro-drivers of the technological competition, including its technology talent pipeline, R&D ecosystem, and national policies.\u201d [57] Finally, as China technology expert Dan Wang wrote: But amid these serious vulnerabilities, China is making rapid progress in many other technologies. Chinese firms have quickly gained ground against their European and Japanese counterparts in the production of advanced machine tools such as robotic arms, hydraulic pumps, and other equipment. As the iPhone demonstrates, China now rivals Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan in its mastery of the electronics supply chain. And in the digital economy, despite recent efforts by President Xi Jinping to tighten government control of Internet companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Didi, China remains strong. Chinese companies can still offer spirited competition to Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants, as ByteDance\u2019s TikTok has been doing to Facebook. China leads the world in building modern infrastructure, including ultra-high-voltage transmission lines, high-speed rail, and 5G networks. In 2019, China became the first country to land a rover on the far side of the moon; a year later, Chinese scientists achieved quantum-encrypted communication by satellite, pushing the country closer to creating unbreachable quantum communications. These achievements are emblematic of China\u2019s steady effort to master more and more difficult tasks. [58] Innovation Analysis Determining what to measure depends in large part on what question one wants to answer. Ideally, innovation should be defined as output and market share in new-to-the world products and services. In other words, invention is not a challenge to market leaders; only innovation is, with innovation being defined as successfully bringing a new product or process to market. Nor are innovation inputs and outputs to the innovation process, such as R&D spending and patents, a challenge to market leaders. Those are useful indicators, but ultimately, they are inadequate to truly measure innovation. Given the lack of adequate Chinese data, it is not possible to measure output and market share for some, if not most, industries and technologies. But it is possible to assess the development of innovative products in many Chinese firms. Chinese-owned companies are the focus, not the Chinese economy, because foreign firm operations in China are much less of a threat to allied economies than Chinese firms are. Foreign firms may move some production and research to China, but their goal is not to displace themselves. In contrast, the goal of many Chinese-owned firms is, like most multinational firms, to win global market share. Moreover, over time, the role of foreign firms in China will continue to shrink as the Chinese government continues its progress with \u201cindigenous innovation\u201d (innovation by Chinese companies). That is why the focus is not on Chinese innovation, but rather on Chinese firm innovation. The notion that \u201cChina\u201d can or cannot do something well is of course misleading. But what do we mean by \u201cnew to the world\u201d? Clearly there is a difference between innovation that is new to a firm or even new to a country. For example, surveys asking Chinese firms if they have innovated show similar, if not even higher, rates than firms in more advanced nations. But this only means that Chinese firms are doing something different than they had been doing, even if that means copying foreign innovations and technologies. Unfortunately, there are no hard and fast definitions of \u201cnew-to-the-world\u201d and \u201cleading edge.\u201d Moreover, for many products, firms incorporate many existing products and innovations, but also add some components and functions that are new. As a rough rule, ITIF defines \u201cleading-edge innovation\u201d as something a firm does no later than a year after something has been introduced somewhere else in the world. Anything longer risks picking up developments that are based more on copying. And a significant part of the new product must be innovative and new. Clearly assessing these factors involves a judgment call. There is no hard and fast rule as to how much copying a firm engages in would disqualify a technology from being defined as innovative. Almost no firm is a completely original innovator. Even Apple incorporated an array of prior innovations to develop the iPhone. But we define copying as largely and substantially using technology and features that are already in existing non-Chinese products, and innovation as the opposite. Over time, the role of foreign firms in China will continue to shrink as the Chinese government continues its progress with \u201cindigenous innovation.\u201d Unfortunately, with the exception of drug approvals for the biopharmaceutical industry, there is no readily available data base assessing the number and extent of innovations from Chinese firms. As such, we use three methods to assess Chinese firm innovation. The first, and least useful, is a review of quantitative innovation indicators, such as R&D personnel, patents, and article citations. These are useful, but not determinative. The second is an analysis of individual Chinese firms. We use as a population of Chinese-headquartered firms listed on the EU R&D 2,500 list (the list of the world\u2019s top 2,500 R&D spenders). A total of 679 Chinese companies were on the 2023 list, and we selected, mostly at random, although we tried to ensure broad sector coverage, 44 companies to examine more closely. At one level, this is a biased sample in that it only includes leading R&D spenders. But these are the kinds of companies most likely to be innovative, so to the extent that they are not, this tells us a lot about Chinse innovation capabilities. While we selected at least 2 companies to fit with the 11 in-depth industry/technology case studies, for the rest, we chose randomly. Relying on native Chinese language researchers, we reviewed company annual reports and investment analyst reports to qualitatively assess the product innovations these companies have developed and the extent to which these are or close to new to the world. ITIF experts then independently scored each firm on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 being a complete copier to 10 being at the leading edge of innovation in the world). Third, we examined nine key industries and technologies important to national security and national economic power: EVS, robotics, semiconductors, chemicals, AI, biotechnology, quantum computing, displays, and commercial nuclear power. Some of these technologies are dual use and important to not only U.S. national security but also its economic security. [59] Others are emerging technologies that help shape technology competition. [60] To do that, we relied on interviews and roundtables with experts on Chinese industries. For the most part, we did not interview experts in China, in part because of current CCP restrictions on sharing information with foreigners, but also because we were not certain we would obtain objective information. A limit of these methodologies is the extent to which firm studies and industry case study results can be generalized. One way we addressed this was to examine a range of companies and industries. But to be sure, both were samples, and it\u2019s possible that the innovation performance of other companies and innovation-based industries is considerably different. Of course, examining even more industries in depth would have been better. But the time cost involved in doing so is extensive. Even with the limitations discussed, the fact that the same general dynamics were found in all 11 industries suggests that the results are likely to be generalizable across virtually all Chinese globally traded industries, especially the ones the Chinese government is targeting. We also chose not to use some cross-national datasets on firm innovation performance, for two reasons. First, national surveys of firm innovation performance (e.g., asking questions such as what percentage of firm revenue came from new products) do not differentiate between products new to a firm, new to a country, and new to the world. Second, these surveys appear to not be comparable across nations. For example, OECD reports that 80 percent of Canadian firms are innovative, compared with 38 percent of American firms, a lead that most Canadian innovation policy experts would find dubious at best. It also reports that 38 percent of Chinese firms are innovative (from the 2108 Chinese Innovation Survey), equal to the U.S. number, and Chinese manufacturing firms overall are the most innovative in the world. This is likely to be more of a result from survey bias than actual performance, just as it appears that Chinese firms over-report R&D expenditures to the government and seek to inflate their innovation performance. [61] It could also be an indication that the survey only asks the firm if it is innovative compared with what it had been doing. For the most part, we also chose to focus on product innovations and not on process innovations for several reasons. First, many process innovations are a way for a firm to lower production costs. China can and does that in many ways, including government subsidies, currency manipulation, and others. Second, and more importantly, it is extremely difficult to measure process innovations because, by definition, they are within the firm and not sold in the marketplace. This should not diminish the importance of process innovation. There are innovations that U.S. companies have come up with, but the United States has lacked the processes and skills needed to make them. This broader manufacturing ecosystem, including technical skills and deep supplier networks, is one reason China has been so successful in advanced manufacturing. [62] One final note on methodology: The goal of this study was not to predict future technological developments. Both private markets, the main determinant, and government policies are themselves highly unpredictable, and the interactions and eventual outcomes among them are even more so. But to use an analogy, if someone observes a sports team with great athletes working out intensely and supported with a massive budget, it\u2019s not unreasonable to predict that this team is likely going to be successful. In other words, while it is not possible to predict the course of technology development (will EVs, or hydrogen vehicles, become dominant?), it is possible to assess current positions and momentum, and that should and can inform likely predictions about the future. Despite the limitations of raw data, the following section examines an array of empirical data sources and studies to assess both trends and levels in Chinese innovation. The overall finding is that, in some areas and industries, China appears to be ahead of the rest of the world, and in most others, it is rapidly catching up. Empirical Data Normally, to assess how innovative a country is compared with others, measures should be examined controlling for the size of the economy. Otherwise, an extremely innovative small country would look less innovative than a very large country that is not very innovative. However, when assessing how innovative Chinese industries are, and the threat that poses to other nations\u2019 industries, total figures are extremely relevant because firms don\u2019t compete against an entire country, but rather against other firms. Therefore, this section examines total figures. Figure 6 shows the number of total full-time researchers in China relative to the number in the United States. In 2011, China\u2019s total number of researchers exceeded 1.3 million, almost 20 percent more than the 1.1 million researchers in the United States. The dashed line represents the total number of researchers in the United States over this same period. By 2021, the gap between China and the United States had increased substantially. The number of researchers in China increased by over 1 million employees to 2.4 million, almost 50 percent more than the total in the United States, 1.6 million. Figure 6: Number of researchers in China relative to number in the United States [63] Figure 7 shows the number of researchers employed by private businesses in China as a percentage of all researchers, relative to the United States. In 2011, 62 percent of full-time researchers in China were employed by private business enterprises compared with 74 percent in the United States. Over the decade, the share of business researchers decreased substantially compared with the United States. In 2021, only 58 percent of researchers were employed by private businesses in China, compared with 83 percent in the United States. This trend reveals an increasing concentration of research conducted in the business sector in the United States, while the opposite occurs in China. Figure 7: China\u2019s researchers in the business sector as a share of total researchers, relative to the United States [64] Figure 8 shows gross expenditure on R&D by performing sector in China relative to the spending in the United States from 2011 to 2022. In all sectors and in overall expenditure, China neared the United States in R&D spending. In 2011, China spent $246 billion on research, just 58 percent of the $427 billion spent by the United States that same year. However, 11 years later in 2022, China had crept much closer to the United States, now spending $811 billion, or 88 percent of the $923 billion spent by America. Sectorally, China has also come close to equaling the United States, represented on the graph as the black dotted line. China spent 86 percent of the United States\u2019 expenditure on government research, and in the business sector, China\u2019s expenditure in R&D was virtually equal to that of the United States; in 2022, China spent $641 billion while the United States spent $646 billion. Figure 8: China\u2019s gross domestic expenditure on R&D by sector, relative to the United States [65] Figure 9 depicts the R&D intensity in China by performing sector, relative to the United States. Between 2012 and 2022, R&D expenditure by private businesses increased in both countries. In 2012, the R&D intensity in China was 1.42 percent or 89 percent of the R&D intensity in the United States. By 2022, the R&D intensity in the business sector in China had declined, while the intensity by government entities increased. Most recent data shows that the R&D intensity in China\u2019s business sector has declined to just 80 percent of the United States, while R&D intensity financed by China\u2019s government has increased to 70 percent of U.S. levels, an increase of 18 percent over the past decade. The dashed line represents the level at which R&D intensity in China would be equal to the United States. Figure 9: R&D intensity in China by performing sector relative to the United States [66] Every year, the European Commission compiles a list of the firms that have invested the greatest amount of money in R&D. Figure 10 shows the number of these firms that were concentrated in the United States and in China. Since 2013, China had made significant gains compared with the United States, represented as the dashed line. In 2013, 658 of the top-R&D-spending firms were located in the United States, almost six times more than the 93 firms located in China. By 2023, the numbers in the United States and China had increased, but not proportionally. China had increased its top R&D firms sevenfold, with 679 firms making the list in 2023. In the United States, 827 firms made the list. Figure 10: Number of global top R&D investment firms in China relative to the United States [67] Figure 11 demonstrates the growth in scientific and technical articles published in China relative to the United States from 2010 to 2020. In 2012, about 330,000 articles were published in China, and just 75 percent of the over 430,000 articles were published in the United States that same year. However, by 2016, China had surpassed the United States. The dashed line represents the number of articles the United States publishes annually. Most recent data from 2022 shows that China continues to exceed the United States, publishing almost 900,000 articles, 47 percent more than the 457,000 published in the United States. Figure 11: Number of science and technical articles published in China relative to the United States To be sure, some of China\u2019s published papers appear to be fraudulent, based on strong incentives to \u201cpublish or perish.\u201d [68] However, one academic study that controlled for a number of independent measures, including type of journal, finds that China is farther ahead in top-level academic journal publications than is generally believed and that China overtook Europe in 2015 and the United States in 2019. Wagner, Zhang, and Leydesdorff wrote: The top-1% analysis using field normalization may have obscured the fact that China is operating at world-leading levels of scientific output in both volume and quality. The increase of the quality of China\u2019s scientific output challenges a number of assumptions about the ways or conditions within which nations build scientific capacity. China\u2019s science policy has propelled the nation to world-class levels in a very short time period, moving the nation\u2019s profile from rapid imitation to levels challenging nations with a longer history of world-leading science. [69] Clarivate, a data analytics company, produces an annual list of highly cited researchers, or \u201cinfluential researchers \u2026 around the world who have demonstrated significant and broad influence in their field(s) of research.\u201d Figure 12 shows the share of these highly cited researchers located in China relative to the United States. In 2018, over 43 percent of highly cited researchers were located in the United States, while only 8 percent were found in China. However, over the next several years, the number of these influential researchers in the United States fell, while in China the opposite occurred. By 2023, the number of highly cited researchers more than doubled there, with 18 percent of all highly cited researchers living in China. Meanwhile, the share of these researchers in the United States fell to 38 percent. Figure 12: Share of highly cited researchers in China relative to the United States [70] Figure 13 shows the number of top 100 global universities in China relative to the United States from 2013 to 2023. In 2013 through 2015, China had no universities in the top 100 of the Academic Ranking of World Universities, a list published by the Center for World-Class Universities, while the United States had over 50 each year. By 2023, China had increased its number of top universities to 11, 29 percent of the 38 universities the United States had in the top 100. Figure 13: Number of top 100 universities in China relative to the United States [71] Figure 14 shows the change in gross VC investment in China relative to the United States from 2015 to 2023. Over this period, VC in both countries saw a relative decrease. In 2015, China saw about $53.2 billion in VC investment, 20 percent more than the $43 billion invested in the United States. The difference in VC investment between China and the United States hit its peak in 2018, when China received $123.5 billion. The United States fundraised just $71 billion that same year. After 2018, China faltered in VC investment, losing a substantial amount of fundraising in the several years following. As of 2023, the two countries each raised about $27 billion in VC fundraising. Figure 14: Gross VC investment in China relative to the United States [72] Figure 15 shows the number of Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent applications for China relative to the number of applications in the United States. From 2011 to 2021, China surpassed the United States, represented by the dashed line, in patent applications. In 2011, Chinese filers applied for just over 17,000 patent applications, only 35 percent of the 49,000 applications from the United States. Over the next decade, both countries increased their patent output; however, China did so faster. In 2019, China officially produced more patents than the United States did for the first time in history, and by 2021, China had produced over 67,000 patent applications per year, 19 percent more than the 56,467 patent applications produced in the United States. Figure 15: Number of PCT patent applications for China relative to the United States [73] China has been known to publish a significant number of false or dubious patents, making the number of sheer patent applications misleading. Instead, looking at the number of patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) can provide a more truthful estimate of the number of legitimate patents published by China. Figure 16 shows the share of patent grants awarded by the USPTO to Chinese firms from 2010 to 2020. In 2010, China was granted just 3,303 patents, less than 1 percent of all patents awarded in the United States that year. Yet, by 2020, China\u2019s patent grants in the United States increased to almost 27,000, 7 percent of all grants. China had the third-most patents granted by USPTO in 2020, behind only the United States and Japan\u2014evidence that, despite some questionable patents, China is publishing many quality patents. Figure 16: Share of patent grants awarded to Chinese firms by USPTO [74] China had the third-most patents granted by USPTO in 2020, behind only the United States and Japan\u2014evidence that, despite some questionable patents, China is publishing many quality patents. Another study of patenting by Bergeaud and Verluise finds that China\u2019s contribution to frontier technology had become quantitatively similar to U.S. levels in the late 2010s while overcoming the European and Japanese contributions, respectively. Although in some ways China still exhibits the hallmarks of a catching-up economy, that veneer has quickly faded. The quality of frontier technology patents published at the Chinese Patent Office has leveled up to the quality of patents published at the European and Japanese patent offices. At the same time, frontier technology patenting at the Chinese Patent Office seems to be increasingly supported by domestic patentees, suggesting the buildup of domestic capabilities. [75] Another study of Chinese patenting finds that, in the last decade, Chinese patents have become less dependent on foreign knowledge and technology, and the importance of Chinese patents relative to USPTO patents has steadily increased over the last two decades. Moreover, Chinese and foreign patenting have become more similar in terms of specialization across technology classes, suggesting that China is now innovating in areas similar to the global leaders. [76] Figure 17 shows the value of IP licensing receipts in China relative to the United States from 2013 to 2023. Over this period, the value of IP licensing receipts in China increased relative to that of the United States. In 2013, IP receipts in China were valued at less than 1 percent of the value in the United States. Yet, by 2023, this value had increased to 9 percent, with a peak of 10 percent in 2022. The United States still maintains a significant lead in the value of IP licensing receipts; however, China has made gains over the past decade. Figure 17: Value of IP licensing receipts by China relative to the United States [77] Since 2017, WIPO has produced an annual report ranking the top 100 science and technology clusters, or \u201clocal concentrations of world-leading science and technology activity.\u201d These clusters are hubs of innovation, with high rates of patent applications, scientific and technical article publication, and great densities of large firms with high rates of R&D investment. Figure 18 shows the number of these hubs that were located in China relative to the United States between 2017 to 2023. Over this time, China rapidly increased its number of clusters, from just six in 2017 to 23 in 2023. At the same time, the United States, represented by the dashed line, stayed relatively stagnant in its number of clusters, with 22 clusters in 2017 and 21 clusters in 2023. As of 2023, China had two more scientific clusters in the global top 100 than the United States did. Figure 18: Number of WIPO global innovation clusters in China relative to the United States [78] Unicorns are private start-up companies that have a value of over $1 billion. As of April 2024, there were 1,453 unicorn companies, with many concentrated in the science and technology sector. Figure 19 shows the share of unicorns concentrated in the United States and in China. The United States accounts for most of the world\u2019s unicorns at 48 percent, while China holds 23 percent. Figure 19: Unicorns in the United States and China as a share of total unicorns in 2024 [79] Figure 20 depicts the number of supercomputers located in China and the United States as a share of the top 500 supercomputers in the world. In 2024, the United States housed 171 of the top 500 supercomputers, or 34 percent of the most-powerful supercomputers in the world. China, on the other hand, held just 80 supercomputers, or 16 percent of the top 500 supercomputers in the world. Figure 20: Share of supercomputers in the top 500 in China and the United States in 2024 [80] Clarivate also produces an annual list of the world\u2019s top 100 innovators, including companies and research institutions that produce research and innovation with the most significant interindustry impact. Figure 21 shows the number of these companies located in China relative to the United States from 2014 to 2024. In 2014, 46 of the top 100 innovators were located in the United States, while zero were in China. Over the decade, China has increased the number of companies labeled as top innovators, with five firms making the Clarivate list in 2024. The United States, on the other hand, has seen a substantial number of firms fall from the list. As of 2024, 5 Chinese firms made Clarivate\u2019s list of top innovators, 29 percent of the 17 U.S. firms that also received the title. Figure 21: Number of top 100 innovators in China relative to the United States [81] Other data sources paint a similar picture. Since 2017, China has exhibited the largest growth in innovation capacity in the world, according to the European Innovation Scorecard, a report prepared by the EU assessing international innovation using criteria such as international investment, R&D expenditures, and business activities. Over the past seven years, there has been a 28.2 percent increase in China\u2019s innovativeness, earning it the label of a \u201cglobal moderate innovator.\u201d Other world leaders experienced much more constrained growth, such as the EU and South Korea, which both improved by 10 percent. China has shown significant growth in the areas of R&D expenditure in the business sector, trademark applications, and highly cited scientific and technical articles. In these three categories, China is substantially more innovative than the EU. [82] The Australian Strategic Policy Institute\u2019s (ASPI) Critical Technology Tracker also found that China has become the leader in almost all the critical technologies the tracker covers. The tracker focuses on how innovative countries are in foundational technologies such as energy, the environment, defense, nuclear, quantum computing, and many other critical industries. Innovativeness is assessed using the top 10 percent of the most highly cited research publications in those industries from the past 21 years. In the most recent report, China leads in 57 out of the 64 critical technologies from 2019 to 2023, up from just 3 out of 64 from 2003 to 2007. Comparatively, the United States, which led in 60 technologies between 2003 to 2007, now leads in just 7. China is also now viewed as \u201chigh-risk\u201d for holding a monopoly in research for 24 of the technologies in which it leads. [83] China has also generally made progress on WIPO\u2019s Global Innovation Index. (See table 2.) Table 2: China\u2019s scores on select factors from the Global Innovation Index [84] Indicator 2017 2023 R&D 17 15 Knowledge workers 1 12 Innovation linkages 62 27 Knowledge absorption 13 14 Knowledge creation 5 3 Intangible assets 2 1 Creative goods and services 29 28 Select Cases Anecdotes do not make data, but they can tell an interesting story. The following are select cases gleaned from news reports of Chinese innovations. China has developed a staff-less hotel wherein the guests check in and use elevators based on facial recognition. [85] It has built the world\u2019s largest and tallest pig farming facility that is highly automated. It has developed and deployed the world\u2019s largest sodium battery unit capable of powering 12,000 homes. [86] It has landed a craft on the dark side of the moon and returned samples. [87] China has developed an innovative stealth fighter that also deploys drones. [88] Chinese scientists have reportedly come up with a new steel that is ultra tough, yet stretchable. [89] It has launched a satellite with a high-power electric drive. [90] Chinese scientists have developed an innovative solar panel technology involving up-conversion of infrared photons. [91] A Chinese company has built and shipped one of the largest tunnel boring machines. [92] China recently set the world record for the fastest hyperloop train. [93] Reportedly, China has developed plasma technology enabling radar invisibility of military aircraft. [94] A Chinese government research institute reports developing a prototype for a thermoacoustic Stirling generator, something NASA has a patent on but has not yet been developed in the United States. [95] Chinese scientists have apparently developed a revolutionary aircraft engine that can propel a plane to 20,000 km/hr. [96] A government-backed consortium of 40 universities has deployed a 1.2 terabit-per-second network, the fastest in the world, and purportedly is two years ahead of the other nations working on the technology. [97] The Shenzhen library has a fully automated book return system that operates without human intervention. [98] A Chinese research team has developed a high-performance aqueous zinc-ion battery with an ultralong-cycle lifespan in a weak magnetic field. [99] China has tested a maglev train\u2014a train suspended above its tracks via a magnetic field\u2014that operates at speeds of 281 miles per hour. [100] Reportedly, China has developed a fully automated cruise missile production line. [101] In 2024, a Chinese physicist became the first Chinese researcher to win the top U.S. physics prize. [102] China\u2019s lunar probe was sent to the moon in June 2024 and returned to Earth carrying samples. [103] China has developed a robot that can play piano, a complex technological task. [104] It built and operates the largest and most highly automated seaport in the world. [105] It has made major breakthroughs in fusion energy. [106] Just recently, it made significant independent breakthroughs on chip technology. [107] A Chinese firm is the first to sell recyclable wind turbine blades. [108] It has launched satellites with a powerful electric engine. [109] It has launched robots on satellites that have the ability to hack apart other nations\u2019 satellites in space. Chinese scientists have developed lightweight strong steel that is stretchable. [110] Thanks to government support after designating it a priority industry, China became the world\u2019s largest automobile producer in 2009 and is now also the world\u2019s largest producer and exporter of EVs. [111] China landed the first probe on the dark side of the moon in 2019. It began launching the components of its Tiangong space station in 2021, and current NASA administrator Bill Nelson recently stated that China may land astronauts on the moon before the United States is itself able to return. [112] China has recently added to the pantheon of tech giants by producing companies such as Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, and Tencent, and 8 of the 10 fastest companies to reach a one-billion-dollar valuation are Chinese. [113] China is challenging the United States in supercomputers, although the true extent of China\u2019s supercomputing capabilities is now unknown because the Chinese government wants to \u201chide its light\u201d regarding its capabilities. [114] An additional example of Chinese frontier innovativeness, notably in an area in which China transitioned from a copier to a leader, is high-speed rail. China first developed its high-speed rail network with the help of imports and technology transfers from European and Japanese companies. It opened its first railway\u2014between Beijing and Tianjin\u2014in the summer of 2008 in time to show it off to the world as it hosted that year\u2019s Summer Olympics. Since then, China\u2019s high-speed rail network has ballooned and is by far the largest in the world with over 23,500 miles of rail. [115] It has also developed the world\u2019s fastest autonomous train, capable of speeds up to 217 miles per hour, and one of China\u2019s rail producing SOEs, CRRC, has become the world\u2019s largest producer of railway vehicles and related technologies. China has recently developed a prototype for a maglev train that it claims is capable of speeds up to 385 miles per hour. [116] Striking Factoids About Innovation in Key Chinese Industries \u00a7 China installed more industrial robots than rest of the world combined in 2023. \u00a7 In 2013, the U.S. share of global chemicals industry R&D spending was 30 percent, while China\u2019s was 1 percent. By 2022, Chinese chemical companies grew to 16.8 percent, with the U.S. share falling to 18.6 percent. \u00a7 China has more nuclear power plants under constuction than the rest of the world combined. \u00a7 China will add more chipmaking capacity than the rest of the world combined in 2024, with 1 million more wafers a month than in 2023. \u00a7 In 2024, China will account for 62 percent of global EV production. \u00a7 Chinese clinical trials grew 146 percent from 1,040 in 2017 to 2,564 in 2021, the highest for any country. Firm Analysis To answer the question about China\u2019s innovative capabilities, one key is to focus on Chinese company capabilities and performance. From 679 Chinese firms listed on the EU R&D 2,500 list, we randomly selected 44 firms for deeper analysis. Few were at the global leading edge of innovation, although most appeared to be catching up to the leaders and making rapid progress. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is completely a copier with no real original innovation and 10 means the firm is moderately to significantly ahead of the global leading edge of innovation, the mean score was 6: lagging, perhaps 2 years behind, with some original innovation. The highest-ranking firms were Chinese National Nuclear Power (score of 9), drone maker DJI (8.75), QuantumCTek (8.25), EV maker BYD (8), and AI company Zhipu (8). Industry Analyses We relied largely on case study approaches for each industry and supplemented a review of literature and company and analyst reports with roundtable interviews with key experts. Because we sought openness and frankness in the discussion, the participants were anonymous. We also included several in-depth company analysis reports in these industry studies, as well as examined relevant data, such as patents and scholarly research citations. We did not interview Chinese experts, in part because we wanted to ensure objectivity. There are a number of limitations to this overall approach. First, Chinese companies may overstate their level of innovation in order to improve their reputation with shareholders and the CCP. Other companies may do the opposite, hiding their innovative performance for national security reasons. Second, non-Chinese individuals will by definition have less insight into what is actually happening in China than Chinese citizens working in these institutions. But given the overall limitations, we believe that this research framework can provide usable insights into the question of whether China is innovative. All but machine tools were published separately as full reports. Table 3 provides an overall summary. Of the 10 industries, we assessed that China is ahead or at par in two, near the lead in four, and lagging behind in four. With the exception of semiconductors, where progress has been somewhat frustrated by export controls on equipment, and quantum, China\u2019s rate of progress is striking. Table 3: Summary of industry studies\u2019 results Industry Position vs. World Leaders Pace of Progress Robotics Near Rapid Chemicals Lagging Rapid Nuclear Power Ahead Rapid Electric Vehicles/Batteries At Par Rapid Machine Tools Lagging Rapid Biopharmaceuticals Lagging Rapid Semiconductors Lagging Modest Artificial Intelligence Near Rapid Quantum Near Modest Display Technology Near Rapid Robotics While the United States invented robotics, it is now an also-ran, at least in production, with the leading robotics companies located in the engineering powerhouses of Germany, Japan, and Switzerland. However, by volume, both of production and use, China leads the world. And China has significant cost advantages. The enormous and rapidly growing demand for robotics in China means that most of the major Western robot manufacturers have set up production operations there, that existing Chinese companies have expanded, and that many new start-ups have been created. In Shanghai, American ABB and Japan\u2019s Fanuc have built the largest robot production factories in the world, with facilities even more advanced than what Fanuc has in Japan. Japan\u2019s Yaskawa Electric Corporation has built three factories in China that can produce 18,000 units of robots annually. And if recent history is any guide, China is using this foreign investment to capture knowledge and force technology transfer to Chinese robot makers. Even when foreign investors put tight controls on IP theft, there will still be spillover effects in terms of industrial knowledge that will help Chinese firms close the innovation gap. [117] China has many domestic robotics companies, such as Geek Robotics, Hikvision, and Blue Sword (robots for China\u2019s military). In fact, since 2017, there have been over 3,400 robotics start-ups in China, not just industrial robots, but also autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). This was part of China\u2019s \u201c100 Million Robot Program.\u201d Moreover, China has made very rapid progress in the development of robotics companies in the last year. For example, Tracxn lists 188 Chinese robotics start-ups. [118] Of the top 10, 8 have venture investors from outside China, indicating their innovative potential. [119] Many of these start-ups are from Songshan Lake, an industrial development zone south of Dongguan China that has hundreds of robotics companies, both start-ups and established. [120] While some of this may be hype, one Hong Kong professor stated that \u201cpeople here [at Dongguan] can develop a new tech product 5 to 10 times faster than in Silicon Valley or Europe, at one-fifth or one-fourth the cost.\u201d [121] Notwithstanding this growing domestic production, China is still the largest importer of industrial robots, which suggests that it is still relying heavily on foreign technologies. [122] In 2019, 71 percent of new robots in China were sourced from overseas, including from Japan, South Korea, Europe, and the United States. Core components are dominated by Japanese and other firms. [123] For example, Chinese firms hold just 25 percent of market for harmonic gear reducers. Indeed, China is dependent on many imported components. As one Chinese analyst stated, \u201cThe value of imported parts is still very high in the robots exported by China.\u201d [124] In 2022, China exported just 36 percent of the value of robotics that it imported. [125] Another study looks at three key upstream systems going into industrial robots: robot gear reducers, robot controllers, and robot servo systems. [126] These three key inputs account for almost 70 percent of production costs of industrial robots. In 2020, these were predominantly made by foreign companies, particularly from Japan, Germany, and Switzerland. The study suggests that most of China\u2019s industrial robot firms are system integrators, performing lower value-added work. However, China lags behind in at least two areas. The first is software. A differentiator of robot quality and versatility, about 80 percent of the value of today\u2019s robotics is the software. And China still lags behind in industrial software capabilities. As one expert noted, \u201cWe see a lot of copycat hardware, but most of what differentiates vehicle warehouse robots, especially in terms of throughput capacity, is driven by the software capabilities, and China is behind there.\u201d The second is integrated systems development and robotics as a service as a business model, in which Chinese companies are weaker than Western ones. Moreover, many Chinese robotics companies are copiers. One expert reported that Japanese robot producer Fanuc found its foundry cast mark on a Chinese competitor\u2019s robot . As another example, after Boston Robotics developed its dog-like walkable robot, several years later, Chinese companies copied it. While Chinese robots generally do not match the quality of the best Western companies, they usually have a price advantage\u2014and for many companies, particularly those not in high-income countries, such a cost-quality tradeoff is one worth making. For these customers, which are less demanding, the low price is attractive. As one expert told us, many Chinese robots are 80 percent as good as the best foreign ones but are much cheaper. This price point drives sales. According to Dr. Anwar Majeed, associate professor at the School of Robotics at XJTLU Entrepreneur College , \u201cIt is worth noting that its products are estimated to be 30 percent cheaper than their European and Japanese counterparts, allowing them to be more attractive to rising economies.\u201d [127] For example, Chinese firm Humanoid\u2019s price point is around $90,000, five times less than that of Western firms. As one article states, Chinese robot producers are currently competing on cost. [128] Indeed, the strategy appears to be to trade quality for price in order to achieve scale. Gain sales at the low and medium end of the market (from the leading players) and then reinvest (along with help from the government) in higher-end, more-innovative offerings. China is, however, innovating in particular markets. For example, experts have argued that Chinese firms such as Geek and HAI are innovators in the materials handling space. Leader Drive is strong in components. Unitree is a robotics start-up moving fast to close to the gap. Its robots, such as BD, are not quite as good, but they are much cheaper, so they are adopted by universities and other organizations that do not need a high level of quality. China is also making progress in emerging areas of robotics, especially humanoid robots. China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has announced plans to dominate this by 2027 and is providing significant state funding to companies for this purpose. [129] Indeed, leaders say it has a plan to mass-produce humanoid robots that can \u201creshape the world\u201d within two years. [130] China has also used foreign acquisition to gain capabilities. Most notably, in 2016, Midea Group announced its acquisition of German robot maker KUKA. [131] Likewise, Effort bought or invested in three robotics companies in Italy: Evolut, Robox, and W.F.C Group. [132] Chinese industrial robot maker Estun acquired or invested in several foreign robot companies, including BARRETT (a U.S. exoskeleton drive system company) and fMAi (Germany), while partnering with a leading European robot producer, CLOOS. [133] Information robot at the Shenzhen Bao\u2019an International Airport in Shenzhen, China [134] On the whole, it appears that China and Chinese robotic companies recognize that they need to pivot away from being fast followers and copiers to being innovators. One way they are doing this is by focusing on many projects that are cutting edge. Moreover, the government is forcing robotics researchers at universities to rub shoulders with companies. As such, while China is still largely a follower in robotics, it is becoming a fast follower. However, China has followed this path in other technologies to become innovation leaders. A case in point is DJI, the world\u2019s leading drone maker. DJI dominated drones by throwing thousands of engineers and conducting R&D and manufacturing at a scale well beyond anything any other company was doing elsewhere. Similarly, as one study of Chinese robotics argues: Upgrading trajectory of industrial robots \u2026 is similar to the development of the mobile phone sector in China: at first, the domestic firms provided slightly lower quality but much cheaper alternatives to foreign produced high-end phones; and later on, when the domestic firms accumulated enough resources, they could make significant technological breakthroughs and become internationally competitive. [135] As such, there are different views of China\u2019s innovative capabilities. One expert told ITIF that because of this fast progress, \u201cChina is at least on-par, and possibly ahead, of the United States and Europe in robotics. China\u2019s firms are strong on the hardware side of robots, especially for automotive.\u201d One participant stated that \u201cthe Chinese companies are innovators in the materials handling space. They\u2019ve launched products we haven\u2019t in the United States. HAI Robotics would be a good example. But it appears the domestic Chinese firms are getting the most penetration in the second- and third-tier markets, at least on the autonomous mobile robots and robots for retail applications.\u201d However, another expert told us that in the field of AMRs, \u201cChina is deploying a fast follower strategy, but they are rapidly catching up. Right now, their robots aren\u2019t as good as ours, but are much cheaper, so are being adopted by educational institutions or the less serious commercial customers. But that gap is closing.\u201d Another expert said that \u201cChina will be able to close the gap, just a question of how long it takes.\u201d Overall, one reflection of how China is not leading in terms of innovation (and quality) is the fact that foreign firms probably account for 75 percent of the Chinese robotic market today, with domestic firms accounting for about 25 percent. Core components are dominated by Japanese firms, but Chinese firms are making quite rapid progress. One reason is the Chinese central government has made global leadership in robotics development, production, and use a top priority\u2014a top industrial priority. China understands that it is behind in robotics and still runs a trade deficit, which is why it has set a goal of moving into higher-end robotics, including humanoid robots, robots to replace workers in dangerous conditions, and high-precision industrial robots. The government has also set national goals for the use of robotics, laying out 11 key areas where it would like more robotic innovation and adoption, including in health care, education, and energy. [136] Chemicals For a long time, China was content to produce commodity chemicals with little focus on either process or product innovation. However, after \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d China has focused more on new chemicals for new applications, including in batteries, semiconductors, and solar panels, with strong government support. As professor Seamus Grimes wrote, China\u2019s rapid growth in its chemical industry \u201chas increased China\u2019s ambition to become a world leader in the chemical industry through innovation and trade and through growing its market share internationally.\u201d [137] Foreign companies still dominate many key areas, but their IP has been eroded over time. Multinationals continue to dominate key parts of the value chain, especially related to high tech and more specialty chemicals. However, the consensus among experts ITIF spoke with is that Chinese companies are beginning to erode the market share of large foreign companies. Part of this has stemmed from Western-company complacency and assumptions that Chinese companies cannot challenge them, and also because of strong Chinese government incentives and support for Chinese chemical companies. And relatively lax chemical industry production regulations help provide China with a competitive advantage. Moreover, unlike biotechnology or software, chemicals is a relatively mature industry with overall rates of innovation lower than more-advanced, innovation-based industries. There are approximately 300,000 chemicals available, but only around 2,000 or so new chemicals are developed each year, a rate of around just 6 percent. [138] This means that, as a slow-innovation industry, it should be easier for China to catch up to the leaders. In basic chemicals, China is increasing its position as a net exporter. In very few commodity chemical products is China a net importer. For example, China has overcapacity for polypropylene; however, China runs a trade deficit in specialty chemicals. As a result, China\u2019s MIIT is focused on boosting China\u2019s capabilities in specialty chemicals, as this will determine global chemical industry leadership. In contrast, the EU-27 runs a trade deficit in basic inorganics and petrochemicals but a trade surplus in specialty chemicals and consumer chemicals. [139] One advantage for China is that the chemical sector is connected to specific sectors, such as automobiles, electronics, renewable energy, etc. Because Chinese production in many of these products is so large and growing so fast, local chemical companies have an advantage by being close to their customers. Seamus Grimes noted that \u201ca number of R&D managers acknowledged that more recently their innovation in China was being driven by innovative Chinese customers.\u201d [140] In addition, because of China\u2019s significant coal reserves and a willingness to keep burning coal, China is leading in coal-derived chemicals. However, China is highly dependent on other countries for high-quality chemical products, high-end equipment in the chemical industry, and leading technology. For example, MIIT stated in 2018 that 32 percent of 130 basic chemicals could not yet be produced in China at all, and more than half of all fine chemical products would still have to be imported. [141] One way China has closed the gap with world leaders, especially in commodity chemicals, is by relying on foreign producers investing in China, a model it has used in multiple industries. For example, of the top 10 coatings companies in China, 4 are local and 6 are foreign. Moreover, by one estimate, about one-third to half of the top executives at Chinese chemical companies have had significant experience at multinationals. This skill base clearly helps Chinese companies catch up. Experts also pointed to the fact that domestic companies usually have significant price advantages, in part because some are state-owned and don\u2019t have to earn as high a profit as the foreign companies and because multinationals have higher global overhead costs. And many Chinese-owned chemical companies receive government subsidies. Experts also argued that Western companies are more goal oriented and short term in their orientation. They have specific procedures and slower decision-making models. Chinese companies, in part because they are trying so hard to catch up and because of the encouragement of the state, are more aggressive. For example, if a European chemical company is doing well in China, it may eventually decide to increase capacity by 20 percent. In contrast, a corresponding Chinese company is likely to quickly agree to double its capacity to gain market share. Even when times are not good, many Chinese firms will increase capacity, just as they have done in other industries such as solar and steel. And like in steel and solar, this creates overcapacity. Once this happens, some foreign firms divest to private equity because they see it as a cash-cow business that no longer meets their financial hurdles. Indeed, China has killed or shrunk a number of overseas companies through a superior cost position and economies of scale. Chinese companies are not as deterred by short- to medium-term earnings setbacks. For foreign companies that stay in the business, they are doing more R&D in China, which will spill over to domestic Chinese companies. Originally, multinational chemical companies did not perform a lot of R&D in China. But now with some of their most important customers in China, more are expanding their R&D spending there. One reason is that of the top 10 metropolitan areas in the world to locate chemical industry R&D facilities ranked in terms of quality of the research, 3 were Chinese (Guangzhou, #1, Shanghai #3, and Beijing #6). [142] Strikingly, no Chinese metro made the top 10 in terms of cost of operating an R&D facility. China is also investing significant amounts in chemical research capabilities in universities, which has paid off in terms of the number of academic papers. In fact, China has overtaken the United States as the main source of academic papers in the field. However, experts argue that limits on the number of skilled domestic Chinese R&D leadership personnel holds back innovation. There was a consensus among experts ITIF spoke with that China will, over time, eventually come to dominate the global chemical industry and, absent significant market closures by Western nations, there is little that can be done about it. In many areas, such as the lithium battery chemistry, initial advances were made in the United States. But U.S. companies haven\u2019t followed up on them and instead Chinese firms have innovated ways to manufacture these batteries and materials at scale and lower cost. And, as in solar panels, China has shown an effectiveness at process innovation. China may be able to make significant strides in innovation with the industry currently facing a global inflection point as it goes through a \u201cgreening\u201d process. The Chinese government is focused on helping firms develop chemicals that meet green requirements and are more environmentally friendly. This includes coating materials for transportation equipment, biodegradable materials, and materials in batteries. Finally, China historically has been a copier of process technology. However, as one article states, \u201cFor the past two decades, China has invested heavily in R&D. The research was initially aimed at developing new products, but process development has more recently turned into a major focus.\u201d [143] The article goes on to state that \u201cforeign chemical companies start to see China as a source of manufacturing expertise.\u201d [144] A good summary of the Chinese position and trends comes from Chinese chemical industry expert Kai Pflug, who wrote: In the past, Chinese pressure on the Western chemical industry came from below\u2014China captured more and more of the market segments with limited innovation and complexity. What is new about the current wave of Chinese domestic investments in chemicals is that these now target precisely the chemical segments that are the most innovative, which tend to also be the fastest growing ones. So far, Western chemical companies survived by out-innovating the Chinese\u2014the latest developments show that this approach is far from certain to work in the future. In a worst-case scenario, this would only leave Western companies with smaller-volume chemicals, in which the scale-oriented Chinese players typically are less interested. [145] China has long and successfully sought to grow its chemical industry. That success has been mostly in basic, commodity chemicals. However, it is now seeking to achieve the same success in more innovation-based specialty chemicals, with the central government targeting chemical innovation. The 2023 \u201cGuiding Catalog for Industrial Structure Adjustment\u201d advocates for the development of a number of new materials related to the chemical industry, including low-VOC (volatile organic compound) adhesives, water treatment agents, catalysts, electronic chemicals, silicone materials, and fluorine materials. [146] The Chinese government provides significant direct and indirect subsidies to chemical firms. [147] In addition, it is upgrading chemical parks. Under this plan, 10 or so leading companies are to be \u201ccultivated\u201d as \u201cnational champions.\u201d In addition, as noted, Chinese governments provide a range of financial incentives, including low-interest loans. The government has also set a goal that the share of fine chemicals in total chemical production in China is to be at least 50 percent. Machine Tools [148] Machine tools are used to remove or add material from a workpiece. [149] To date, China has largely been a copier. But if China can prove to be a true innovator, American machine tool companies will become vulnerable. In 1981, the United States was the largest producer of machine tools at $5.1 billion. [150] By 2022, China was the world\u2019s leading producer at $27.1 billion per year, while the United States ranked fifth at $5.9 billion. [151] However, even though China\u2019s domestic companies produce more than 95 percent of the domestic demand for low-end computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools, over 90 percent of its high-end CNC tools are still imported. [152] Over time, the U.S. global market share in machinery and equipment has decreased while China\u2019s has increased. (See figure 22.) [153] In 2000, the United States held a 23 percent global market share, and China held just 6 percent. [154] By 2020, China had a 32 percent share while the United States only had 15 percent. [155] The United States has witnessed a decline in machine tool manufacturing. [156] Industry output is increasing at a rate slower than GDP. In contrast, China has experienced an upward trend in the metal-cutting machine tools industry, growing at a rate faster than GDP. [157] Figure 22 : U.S. and Chinese firms\u2019 global market shares in machinery and equipment [158] In addition, from 1999 to 2020, U.S. firms filed more machine tool patents than did Chinese firms at the three major offices: European Patent Office, Japan Patent Office, and USPTO. [159] In 1999, the United States filed 258 patents while China filed just 2. [160] But by 2020, the United States filed only 20 patents while China filed 3. [161] However, filing 493 patents in 2019 alone, Japan surpassed the United States and China as the top machine tool patent filer from 1999 to 2020. [162] Germany had a slight lead ahead of the United States with 188 and 120 patents filed in 2019, respectively. [163] Chinese machine tools are considered low end and low tech. [164] According to the Strategic Study of Chinese Academy of Engineering, China\u2019s machine tool industry trails behind advanced international countries by 15 years. [165] For example, fewer than 20 Chinese manufacturers of machine tools have upgraded their production lines to incorporate Industry 4.0 standards, such as IoT technologies and AI, within the high-end CNC market. [166] Consumers of Chinese-made machine tools have also reported product defects, including oil, liquid, and gas leaks. [167] Moreover, China has yet to implement additive manufacturing into the machining process on a large scale due to inadequate development. [168] In addition, the average time between system failure of Chinese machine tools is 600 to 2,000 hours, while foreign ones have an average time of over 5,000 hours. [169] China\u2019s multi-axis machine tools have a utilization rate, which is a measure of the equipment\u2019s productivity, of 15\u201330 percent and an acceleration due to gravity lower than 0.8 g. [170] However, foreign machine tools have a utilization rate of 60\u201390 percent and a minimum acceleration of 1\u20131.5 g. [171] In particular, China\u2019s ultraprecision machine tools have a submicrometer processing precision, which is worse by one to two orders of magnitude compared with technologically advanced countries. [172] In an attempt to boost competitiveness, Chinese machine tool companies such as Shenyang Machine Tool have tried to out-innovate the United States by copying American technology. In 2016, the company released the i5M8, the world\u2019s first integrated smart machine tool, with a high machining precision of 0.003 mm. [173] Manufacturers can create eight different models of one tool in either three-, four-, or five-axis formats. But Shenyang\u2019s i5 series is far from innovative. The operating system is a replica of Apple\u2019s iOS and its cloud platform mimics Apple\u2019s iCloud. [174] By utilizing Apple\u2019s proprietary technology and marketing the product as if China invented the machine, this example exemplifies China\u2019s inability to be a true innovator. And up to 2020, the system largely produced two- and three-axis machine tools rather than high-precision four- and five-axis machines the company boasted about. [175] China\u2019s inability to be a true innovator stems from Chinese firms\u2019 incapability to produce high-end core components of machine tools, such as rolling components. Rolling components, including ball screws and roller linear guide rails, help to increase machine tool efficiency and accuracy and lower energy dissipation. But more than 90 percent of these critical parts are imported. In addition, the production of high-end precision bearings, another vital component of machine tools, is largely dominated by Japanese, German, Swedish, and American firms, accounting for more than 70 percent of the global bearing market. Chinese firms are also looking at innovative ways to incorporate automation, robotics, and 3D printing within CNC machines; however, with less than 20 high-end CNC machine producers in China, advanced countries such as Japan and Germany have been able to easily outpace China in terms of the R&D of novel machine tools. Thus, due to the high technical barriers and costs, Chinese firms are hesitant to enter the high-end machine tool market. China\u2019s medium- to high-end machine tool industry is heavily reliant on imports from Asian and European countries. In 2020, the largest share of high-end machine tool imports was from Japan ($2.7 billion) and Germany ($1.3 billion), accounting for 62 percent of total imports. And in particular, foreign businesses makes up 70 percent of China\u2019s medium-end machine tool industry. The Chinese government has made a conscious effort to break this pattern. \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d strives to decrease foreign dependence and increase independent innovation capabilities through the R&D of high-end machine tools and key components. It also aims to cut production cycle time and product defects by 50 percent each. While China lags behind overall, there has been some innovation. In 2017, Zhang Haiou at Huazhong University of Science and Technology created the world\u2019s first 3D printing CNC machine tool with independent IP rights and simultaneous casting and forging capabilities. HuazhongCNC, a Chinese medium to high-end CNC systems manufacturer, launched the Huazhong CNC 9 series intelligent system, the world\u2019s first intelligent CNC system, in 2021. [176] This novel system not only incorporates automation, AI, and Internet of Things, but also has independent learning and decision-making capabilities. Nuclear Power China has become an\u2014if not clearly the\u2014global leader in nuclear reactor technology. [177] Francois Morin, China\u2019s director of the World Nuclear Association, asserted that China is \u201cahead of other countries in terms of nuclear technology research and development.\u201d [178] Overall, analysts assess that China today likely stands 10 to 15 years ahead of the United States in its ability to deploy fourth-generation nuclear reactors at scale. The country expects to build six to eight new nuclear power plants each year for the foreseeable future, with the average construction time for those reactors averaging about seven years. In total, China intends to build a total of 150 new nuclear reactors between 2020 and 2035. To be sure, the bulk of the nuclear reactors Chinese firms are currently deploying are based on the Westinghouse Electric-designed AP1000, which became the first Generation III+ reactor to receive final design approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), in 2004. In 2007, Westinghouse won a China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) bid for four AP1000 reactors, although this also included a major technology transfer agreement that significantly accelerated the advancement of China\u2019s commercial nuclear power industry, leading to the development of China\u2019s CAP1400 reactor. What needed technology China could not get from voluntary tech transfer, it simply stole: In 2010, hackers working with the Chinese military penetrated Westinghouse\u2019s computer systems and stole confidential and proprietary technical and design specifications for Westinghouse\u2019s AP1000. [179] While China did not excel at innovating the CAP 1400, it did excel at taking the steps needed to deploy it. In fact, while China was deploying its version of the AP1000 as early as 2017, America\u2019s first installation of the Generation III+ reactor only came online in 2023. This points to China\u2019s strengths in systemic and organizational innovation when it comes to nuclear power, and especially refers to the country\u2019s coherent national strategy toward nuclear power\u2014at both federal and provincial levels. This strategy entails a range of supportive policies, from low-interest financing, feed-in tariffs, and other subsidies that make nuclear power generation cost competitive to streamlined permitting and regulatory approval (i.e., of safety and environmental impact assessments) to coordinating supply chains in an effective fashion. Moreover, in the future, China will be deploying Chinese-designed fourth-generation nuclear reactors with 93.4 percent of the materials used in a new $16 billion facility, the Shidaowan 1, domestically sourced. [180] China has also led construction of the world\u2019s first multipurpose small modular reactor (SMR) demonstration project, known as the Linglong One. It was the first SMR to receive approval from the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics is slated to launch the world\u2019s first molten salt and thorium nuclear reactor, the TMSR-LF1. While thorium-based reactors are not entirely novel, what differentiates them is their utilization of thorium as a fuel source within a molten salt reactor. [181] In December 2021, China became the third country to develop a floating nuclear reactor, the ACPR50S, which has been designed to endure the equivalent of a once-in-10,000-years weather catastrophe. [182] Ultimately, the Generation IV International forum\u2014a cooperative international endeavor among 13 countries seeking to develop the research necessary to test the feasibility and performance of fourth-generation nuclear systems and make them available for industrial deployment by 2030\u2014has identified six different reactor types as \u201cGen IV\u201d: the gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR), the lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR), the molten salt reactor (MSR), the sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR), the supercritical-water-cooled reactor (SCWR), and the very high-temperature reactor (VHTR). [183] Notably, across various projects, China is trying to build reactors of each of these types. [184] China is also making significant progress in nuclear fusion. In 2024, the Chinese government launched an industrial consortium to promote the development and advancement of fusion. [185] The Chinese government has also launched new fusion education programs in China, with a goal of training 1,000 new plasma physicists to support these initiatives. [186] The government has set a goal of building the first industrial prototype fusion reactor, which it has dubbed an \u201cartificial sun,\u201d by 2035, with officials hoping to begin large-scale commercial production of fusion energy by 2050. [187] Industry analysts ITIF interviewed have observed that China appears to be roughly on par today with U.S. efforts to develop nuclear fusion technologies. However, a July 2024 Wall Street Journal article finds that the Chinese government is now nearly doubling the U.S. government\u2019s R&D investments in nuclear fusion\u2014roughly $1.5 billion annually for China compared with $790 million for the United States\u2014although these figures did not count private-sector investment. Nevertheless, the Journal reported , \u201cScientists familiar with China\u2019s fusion facilities said that if the country continues its current pace of spending and development, it will surpass the U.S. and Europe\u2019s magnetic fusion capabilities in three or four years.\u201d [188] When it comes to innovation inputs, China placed 7 of the top 22 enterprises in the \u201c2023 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard\u201d for their R&D investment intensity toward nuclear innovation. China\u2019s performance was stronger with regard to scientific publications and patents in nuclear engineering. As of 2022, China ranked third in terms of nations with citations among the top 10 percent of highly cited publications in nuclear science and engineering, with 339 such publications, compared with EU-27 nations with 457 such publications and American ones with 399. China\u2019s number of such publications increased fourfold between 2008 and 2021. China is a leader not only in the quantity of nuclear energy publications, but also in \u201chigh-quality\u201d publications. China has surpassed the United States in its deployment of the current generation of nuclear reactors and in the development and deployment of fourth-generation nuclear reactors. Chinese firms are developing indigenous innovation capabilities in the sector, and China\u2019s growth in high-impact scientific publications and increased share of global patents awarded in the sector suggest that Chinese enterprises will only become more competitive in the civilian nuclear energy industry in the future. Semiconductors China\u2019s government has prioritized semiconductors, investing hundreds of billions of dollars to catalyze the development of an indigenous semiconductor ecosystem and ideally cultivate globally competitive semiconductor firms across virtually all segments, from semiconductor design and fabrication to semiconductor manufacturing equipment to assembly, test, and packaging (ATP). Thus far, however, those efforts have met with uneven success. With regard to the fabrication of leading-edge logic semiconductor chips, China\u2019s flagship competitor, the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) likely stands about five years behind global leaders such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). [189] Chinese competitors are even further behind with regard to semiconductor manufacturing equipment, such as the lithography tools that make semiconductors. One commentator noted that Chinese firms might be as many as five generations behind in this field. [190] As another analyst explained, \u201cThe best machinery a Chinese company can produce makes chips that are 28 nm wide; the industry\u2019s cutting-edge equipment can make 2 nm chips.\u201d [191] That said, Chinese semiconductor firms appear to be catching up in certain pockets. Manufacturing semiconductors starts by designing them, making electronic design automation (EDA) software that assists in the definition, planning, design, implementation, verification, and subsequent manufacturing of semiconductors vitally important. Historically, EDA has \u201cconstitute[d] a weak link in the PRC\u2019s efforts to build a leading domestic semiconductor value chain.\u201d [192] However, in March 2023, Huawei announced that it had achieved a number of breakthroughs in the development of EDA software, which it suggested would free China\u2019s industry from reliance on foreign suppliers of those tools when producing semiconductors of 14 nm or more. [193] Still, Chinese firms clearly lag behind global leaders in the EDA space. EDA represents a key input to designing semiconductors, and China\u2019s weakness there has historically hampered its semiconductor design firms. Chinese design firms accounted for only 8 percent of global design revenue in 2022, with no Chinese firms among the top 25 global design firms. [194] Nevertheless, as one report notes, \u201cChina\u2019s design industry has rapidly increased in size since 2015, driven by factors such as the widespread availability of capital (including from both the government and private sector), government support, a desire to localize the industry, demand growth, the acquisition of foreign firms, and downstream users designing their own semiconductors.\u201d [195] In fact, from 2010 to 2022, the number of semiconductor design firms in China increased nearly sixfold, from 582 to 3,243. [196] When it comes to designing and manufacturing advanced logic semiconductor chips, Chinese enterprises have caught up in pockets, but overall remain well behind global leaders. The real bottleneck comes with regard to the capability to manufacture advanced process node (i.e., sub-7 nm) chips. While China\u2019s flagship fabricator, SMIC, is manufacturing at 7 nm, it\u2019s generally with more expensive, time-consuming, and lower-yield processes; in other words, while SMIC can do high-volume, high-yield manufacturing at 28 nm, it has yet to master the practice at 7 nm, let alone sub-7 nm levels, and leaders such as Intel and TSMC continue to push leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing down to the sub-2 nm level. To be sure, Chinese firms have recorded some successes in advanced logic chips. For instance, in August 2023, Huawei released the Mate 60 Pro smartphone, which deployed the 7 nm Kirin 9000S chip (which Huawei\u2019s HiSilicon design arm architected) and was manufactured by SMIC using its SMIC N+2 process technology \u201cwith capabilities that shocked the world in terms of its performance.\u201d [197] As Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis commented, \u201cPut simply, [the] Kirin 9000S is a better designed chip than the West realizes. It has solid power and performance. Even with the lackluster export controls, this is a leading-edge chip that would be near the front of the pack in 2021.\u2026 We cannot overstate how scary this is.\u201d [198] However, the process SMIC uses to make the chip is time-consuming and expensive, making it difficult to manufacture using this process at volume scale, explaining why analysts expected Huawei to ship only 7 million of the MatePro phones in 2023, and perhaps 40 million in 2024. Elsewhere, a plethora of Chinese competitors, including Huawei (with its Ascend chip), Biren, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, and MetaX, are designing AI chips. Patel asserted that these firms \u201cwill soon be able to deliver on chips that are on par with Nvidia\u2019s A100 [using] SMIC 7nm in two years at significant volumes.\u201d [199] Commenting on Huawei\u2019s Ascend GPU chips, one observer noted that Huawei\u2019s highest-end product is likely comparable to an NVIDIA H800 in most features save for energy efficiency. Biren\u2019s BR100 processor competes in the market against NVIDIA\u2019s H100, delivering powerful performance speeds, but industry observers noted that NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA ecosystem, which tightly integrates hardware and software, is likely more attractive than Biren\u2019s competing offering. Legacy (or \u201clarger\u201d or \u201cmature\u201d) node chips represent those manufactured using 28 nm or greater process technologies. China has become an ever-more-significant player in this sector of the market, but its basis for competitive advantage here is likely to be more predicated on a large scale (supported by massive, state-driven industrial subsidization) that facilitates price-driven, not innovation-driven, competition. [200] China will account for the most significant share of new semiconductor capacity coming online over the next several years. Indeed, analysts expect that China will add more chipmaking capacity than the rest of the world combined in 2024, with 1 million more wafers a month than in 2023. The semiconductor memory industry has long been a strategic priority for China\u2019s economic development. [201] Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC), China\u2019s leading NAND maker, represents a Chinese state-controlled joint venture launched by the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, supported by $24 billion in initial government funding allocated for its initial Wuhan factory alone. [202] ChangXin Memory Technologies (CMXT) is another Chinese-government-created semiconductor manufacturer, focusing on DRAM technology. YMTC got off to a hot start, \u201cmov[ing] rapidly up the NAND manufacturing curve, producing 128-layer NAND and moving rapidly toward more advanced processes, at 232 layers and above.\u201d [203] A TechInsights article finds that YMTC introduced \u201cthe first 200+ layer 3D NAND Flash\u201d on the market, ahead of rivals Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron. [204] In 2022, Apple considered acquiring YMTC\u2019s NAND memory chips for use in iPhones and iPads to be sold in China, and reportedly wanted to increase the order up to 40 percent of the chips required for all iPhones. [205] As one observer noted, \u201cYMTC\u2019s products are as good as anyone else\u2019s.\u201d However, when the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s (DOC\u2019s) Bureau of Industry Security added YMTC to its \u201cEntity List\u201d in December 2022, it significantly impeded YMTC\u2019s expanse, resulting in YMTC laying off 10 percent of its staff. [206] For its part, CXMT has become the workhorse DRAM company in China, but \u201cthe company faces significant challenges in the execution of its roadmap,\u201d and analysts don\u2019t regard it as competing at the leading edge. [207] As Paul Triolo wrote, \u201c[K]ey players like memory makers YMTC and CXMT [are] hobbled by lack of access to cutting-edge tools, but still capable of producing useable memory.\u201d [208] Lithography represents a crucial step in the chipmaking process, wherein a chip wafer gets inserted into a lithography machine and exposed to deep ultraviolet or extreme ultraviolet light and a pattern is printed onto a chip\u2019s resist layer through a photomask. As such, catching up in lithography has long been a central focus of China\u2019s chip aspirations, with the efforts going back to China\u2019s \u201cProject 02,\u201d launched in 2008. Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment Group (SMEE), China\u2019s leading lithography developer, claimed in December 2023 to have successfully developed a 28 nm lithography machine, the SSA/800-10W. [209] However, analysts question SMEE\u2019s ability to produce 28 nm lithography equipment at scale. Overall, the domestic market share of Chinese producers of wafer-fabrication tools rose from 4 percent in 2019 to 14 percent in 2023. Lastly, ATP represents the final step in semiconductor manufacturing. As of 2021, China accounted for 27 percent (134) of the world\u2019s 484 ATP facilities. By August 2023, Chinese ATP firms commanded 38 percent of the market, with the five largest OSAT players\u2014JCET, HT-Tech, TF, LCSP, and Chippacking\u2014all being Chinese. [210] However, while Chinese firms are cost competitive in the ATP sector, industry observers at an ITIF roundtable contended that \u201cwhile China has made some progress \u2026 it really doesn\u2019t have that capability on the leading edge\u201d of semiconductor ATP. [211] With regard to innovation inputs, China\u2019s semiconductor industry is not nearly as R&D-intensive as other leading nations\u2019 semiconductor sectors. In 2022, its semiconductor-sector R&D intensity of 7.6 percent was just 40 percent of America\u2019s 18.8 percent, and well below the EU-country average of 15 percent, or Taiwan\u2019s 11 percent. Chinese researchers have also made impressive strides in the number and quality of their scientific publications in semiconductors. Considering the h-index, a measure of the productivity and citation impact of scientific publications, China counts seven institutions in the global top-20 research institutions releasing advanced integrated circuit and design publications. [212] Ultimately, Chinese enterprises are innovating as rapidly as they\u2019re able to in this industry\u2014and they have made some notable achievements and advancements\u2014but overall, they remain behind global leaders in the semiconductor industry. Electric Vehicle and Battery Industries The more than 200 EV manufacturers operating in China will produce an estimated 10 million EV units in 2024. In 2022, China accounted for 62 percent of global EV production (though this figure also counts Western manufacturers such as Tesla operating in China) and 59 percent of global EV sales. [213] Similarly, China\u2019s battery manufacturing capacity in 2022 stood at 0.9 terawatt hours, roughly 77 percent of the global share. [214] China\u2019s two largest EV battery producers\u2014CATL and FDB\u2014alone account for over one-half of global EV battery production. The Chinese government\u2014at both the federal and provincial levels\u2014has made EV competitiveness a national priority. But while China\u2019s EV industry has certainly benefitted from intense government support, Chinese EV and EV battery enterprises have become increasingly innovative in their own right across a number of dimensions of product innovation, process innovation, business model innovation, and even customer experience innovation. Collectively, Chinese EV and EV battery enterprises have at least equaled\u2014and in some cases surpassed\u2014their Western peers in innovation capacity and product quality. Indeed, as one report observes, many contend that \u201cChina is the epicenter of EV innovation.\u201d [215] As commentators at the ITIF roundtable of experts on China\u2019s EV industry observed, \u201cChinese enterprises are very innovative, especially in EVs\u201d and \u201cChina is doing really remarkable, innovative work in the vehicle electrification space.\u201d [216] Overall, research firm Bernstein estimates that Chinese EVs can cost half as much to make as European ones, even while they can boast of better technology. [217] Chinese enterprises have made critically important breakthroughs in EV battery chemistry. As Zeyi Yang wrote in MIT Technology Review , \u201cJust a few years ago, LFP [Lithium iron phosphate] batteries were considered an obsolete technology that would never rival NMC [nickel manganese cobalt batteries] in energy density.\u201d [218] But today, LFP batteries account for about 40 percent of the global market for EVs, and as Yang wrote, \u201cIt was Chinese companies, particularly CATL, that changed this consensus through advanced research.\u201d [219] Chinese EV battery makers such as CATL and WeLion now sell LFP EV batteries with a 1,000 km (621-mile) range off a single charge. [220] And some Chinese EV battery start-ups are now working to develop EV batteries they assert will have a 2,000 km (1,300-mile) range. [221] As another commentator explained, this is \u201cpurely down to the innovation within Chinese cell makers. And that has brought Chinese EV battery [companies] to the front line, the tier one companies.\u201d [222] Chinese EV makers are also leading in other aspects of vehicle technology, from innovative vehicle suspension systems to the incorporation of a range of novel digital features, including such features as autonomous driving and interactive voice controls to multiple touch screens that enable everything from watching movies to singing karaoke. Retail showroom for BYD electric vehicles in Shanghai, China [223] Chinese firms are also aggressively innovating vehicle production processes, from robotic automation to digital production systems (i.e., digitalized manufacturing execution systems) to innovative aluminum diecasting processes. For example, Chinese EV maker Xiaomi has made important innovations on the diecasting process Tesla pioneered, such as building an AI program that uses a method known as deep learning to simulate how different materials behave when placed inside a die-cast machine. [224] Process innovations such as these have enabled Chinese EV manufacturers to accelerate the pace of product innovation. One assessment finds that Chinese EV companies are 30 percent faster in developing and releasing a new car model than \u201clegacy\u201d American, European, and Japanese carmakers are. In fact, Chinese EV makers offer models for sale for an average of only 1.3 years before they are updated or refreshed, compared with 4.2 years for foreign brands. [225] In terms of automotive companies\u2019 levels of R&D investments, as reported in the \u201c2023 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard,\u201d China placed 8 of the top 15 companies in the study. Nio and XPeng were the leading Chinese companies, with an R&D intensity of about 21.3 percent of its revenue. That is ahead of well-known automotive manufacturers including Ferrari and Aston Martin. Chinese EV enterprises are backed by an increasingly capable support ecosystem, including everything from the quality of the R&D conducted at Chinese universities and research institutions to a deep local supplier base. In particular, the number and quality of Chinese scientific publications pertaining to EVs and EV batteries has increased markedly in recent years. For instance, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) found that Chinese institutions account for 65.4 percent of the high-impact publications for electric batteries, substantially outpacing the United States\u2019 11.9 percent. And, as ASPI wrote, \u201cThe Chinese Academy of Sciences is a stand-out performer in the Critical Technology Tracker datasets. It leads in six of the eight energy and environment technologies [and is] no. 1 globally for electric batteries.\u201d [226] Meanwhile, Chinese entities\u2019 global share of patents in the field of electric propulsion increased 11-fold from 2.4 percent in 2010 to 26.9 percent in 2020. While certainly the highest-end Western firms such as BMW and Tesla remain at the forefront of the global EV market, Chinese firms such as BYD, Xiaomi, and Li Auto are competing effectively at the luxury EV level, while in the mid-market, BYD, JiYue, Nio, and others are excelling at delivering attractive, cost-competitive EVs. China\u2019s leadership in EVs certainly began as a result of intentional industrial policy and guidance, especially through market-making activities such as intensive industrial subsidization. However, from that base, Chinese EV players have become increasingly capable, innovative, and competitive in their own right. Artificial Intelligence The United States has long led in AI, thanks to cutting-edge research and a strong private sector, but China\u2019s relentless, state-driven approach is closing the gap fast. The outdated narrative of China as merely a copier is being replaced by evidence of its strong academic institutions and innovative research, which have produced most of China\u2019s leading AI start-ups. U.S. efforts to slow China down are unlikely to work in the long run, so if America doesn\u2019t ensure that it stays ahead, it could find itself outpaced by a rival that\u2019s advancing with impressive speed and focus. China\u2019s ascent in AI is marked by a series of strategic moves that have transformed its research landscape. For years, China has been churning out AI research at an impressive volume, although it is often perceived as lagging behind in quality compared with that from the United States. This narrative is changing. Today, China and America are neck and neck in generative AI research output, each contributing thousands of papers that push the boundaries of what AI can achieve. However, where U.S. research tends to lead in impact\u2014evidenced by higher citation counts and more significant involvement from private companies\u2014China\u2019s research is rapidly gaining recognition, especially in fields in which it directly competes with American efforts. At the heart of China\u2019s AI revolution is Tsinghua University, a powerhouse of academic innovation that has become the breeding ground for some of the country\u2019s most promising AI start-ups. Companies such as Zhipu AI, Baichuan AI, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax\u2014collectively dubbed the \u201cAI tigers\u201d\u2014are not merely replicating Western technologies but are also carving out their niches in the global AI landscape. These firms, often led by Tsinghua alumni, are at the forefront of developing large language models (LLMs), some of which now outperform their U.S. counterparts in bilingual benchmarks. This is no small feat, considering the complexity of training AI systems to operate effectively in multiple languages. China\u2019s approach to AI is deeply intertwined with its broader economic and industrial strategies, and the country has identified AI as a critical component of its future growth, integrating it into key sectors such as manufacturing and healthcare. The Chinese government\u2019s support for AI extends beyond mere rhetoric; it is manifest in substantial financial backing, through both direct state funding and the creation of favorable conditions for private investment. This support is particularly evident in regions where private capital has traditionally been scarce, allowing high-potential firms to flourish in areas that might otherwise be overlooked. Yet, while China\u2019s AI ecosystem is rapidly maturing, it still faces significant challenges. In terms of private AI investment, the United States continues to dwarf China, with American firms attracting far more VC and producing a greater number of groundbreaking AI models. However, this gap may begin to close as foreign investors, including significant players such as Saudi Arabia\u2019s Aramco, begin to see the potential in China\u2019s AI sector. Moreover, China is also leading the world in generative AI patents, dominating the top 20 slots globally, which is a strong indicator of its growing innovation capabilities. One of the most striking aspects of China\u2019s AI strategy is its open source LLM ecosystem, which is advancing at a pace that has caught the attention of global AI communities. Models such as Alibaba\u2019s Qwen 1.5 and Zhipu AI\u2019s ChatGLM3 are not only competitive, but are also starting to set benchmarks in various applications. This is complemented by China\u2019s aggressive pursuit of a national data strategy designed to enhance the availability and quality of data, which is crucial for training advanced AI models. However, the question remains: Can China sustain this momentum and translate its research prowess into global leadership in AI? While China\u2019s progress is undeniable, the United States still leads in key areas, particularly in the commercialization of AI technologies and the development of foundational models that underpin a wide range of AI applications. The U.S. private sector\u2019s deep integration with academic research continues to give it an edge in producing AI that is both innovative and practical. China\u2019s rapid advancements in AI reflect a nation that is no longer content with being a follower. Through a combination of strategic state intervention, robust academic output, and increasing private investment, China has positioned itself as a serious competitor in the global AI race. Whether it can overtake the United States remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: American dominance in AI should not be taken for granted. Displays Electronic displays have become an integral part of the modern global digital economy, representing the key visual and tactile (via touchscreens) human interface for a wide variety of consumer electronics from televisions, computers, mobile phones, tablets, and vehicles to a range of other applications, such as medical devices and refrigerators. Displays also play vital roles in national defense capabilities, from the heads-up displays in fighter jet cockpits to the combat information centers on navy ships. Analysts estimate that the global display market will generate $182 billion in sales in 2024 and more than double in size over the next decade to become a $372 billion market by 2034. [227] And while Chinese enterprises used to be bit players in an industry once dominated largely by South Korean firms, China\u2019s share of global liquid-crystal display (LCD) production has reached 72 percent, while its share of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) production exceeds 50 percent. Chinese players surpassed South Korean ones for the first time in Q1 2024 as the leading producer of OLED panels. [228] Moreover, China\u2019s prowess in displays is increasingly driving the competitiveness of its TV manufacturers. China\u2019s aggressive subsidization of the display industry has driven down prices and led to overcapacity, thus depressing profitability for foreign competitors that have to earn market-based rates of return to persist in the industry. In the LCD sector, this approach has succeeded in driving most foreign competitors out of the industry\u2014Japanese companies stopped investing in the sector wholesale around 2010\u2014or precluded other would-be competitors from entering the industry. While Chinese display makers such as BOE, TCL, Tianma, and Visionox certainly started behind leading peers (notably Japan\u2019s Sharp, South Korea\u2019s LG, and Samsing Display), they are increasingly developing innovative products in their own right, as reflected by BOE and TCL increasingly winning prestigious awards in the field, such as at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). For instance, at the 2023 CES, TCL-CSOT (China Star Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd., which is TCL\u2019s display subsidiary) won the \u201cInnovation Award for MiniLED Display of the Year.\u201d BOE has developed innovative flexible OLED screens and what it claimed to be the world\u2019s largest 95-inch 8K OLED screen when the company launched it. BOE\u2019s display manufacturing facilities are among the world\u2019s most sophisticated and are extensively automated. [229] BOE has also worked assiduously to develop its patent portfolio; it has been a top 10 global patent filer over each of the past six years (and the fifth-leading patent filer globally in 2023). In summary, China has clearly wrested leadership in the global LCD industry away from other players: In 2004, China accounted for 0 percent of global LCD production, but by 2024 its share had reached 72 percent (as strong a case of \u201ccomparative advantage\u201d being effectively artificially manufactured through industrial policy as there ever could be). Likewise, China\u2019s market share in OLEDs has increased from less than 1 percent in 2014 to over half today; and if current trends continue, then competitors in that segment of the market will be hard-pressed to persist as well. (Indeed, the only route for Korean or Japanese players will be to out-innovate on the front end to develop the next-generation of MinilLED and MicroLED solutions.) Moreover, it turns out that the manufacturing process similarities between fabricating displays and semiconductors are close to 70 percent, meaning that as Chinese firms develop capabilities in display technologies, these may increasingly spill over into semiconductor capabilities, further powering the competitiveness of China\u2019s semiconductor firms. [230] Quantum Computing China dominates in quantum communications, lags behind in quantum computing, and roughly matches the United States in quantum sensing. While the United States has historically led the field of quantum information science (QIS), which harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and transmit information in fundamentally new ways, China has rapidly advanced its capabilities through aggressive state-driven investments and strategic focus\u2014and some of these advancements outstrip the United States in scale and scope, making U.S. leadership in quantum far from assured. Quantum technologies are not only important for national security, but they also have the potential to exert a transformative influence on the economy and society. In quantum communications, China has secured global leadership, as demonstrated by the development of the world\u2019s longest quantum key distribution (QKD) network\u2014the 1,200-mile Beijing-Shanghai backbone. This achievement is complemented by the Micius satellite, which extends quantum communication over even greater distances, solidifying China\u2019s position at the forefront of secure, long-distance quantum communication. However, despite its leadership in quantum communications, this particular field represents a smaller slice of the overall quantum technology landscape compared with computing, particularly in terms of economic impact. Quantum computing, with its vast potential across industries such as pharmaceuticals, finance, and cryptography, is expected to dominate the quantum economy, capturing the lion\u2019s share of market value by 2040. In quantum computing, China lags significantly behind the United States, particularly in hardware development and the practical implementation of quantum systems. Despite substantial state investment and focused efforts, Chinese companies and research institutions have not yet reached the level of breakthroughs achieved by their U.S. counterparts, particularly in areas such as qubit coherence, error correction, and the development of scalable quantum processors. The United States leads in quantum computing by consistently achieving breakthroughs in scalable systems and practical applications, supported by a dynamic collaboration between academia and industry. In quantum sensing, the competition is more balanced, with China leading in certain areas while the United States maintains an edge in others. China\u2019s strengths lie in the rapid commercialization and application of quantum sensing technologies, particularly in sectors such as defense and healthcare, where these technologies are already making significant impacts. The United States, on the other hand, leads in the quality of research of cutting-edge sensing applications, maintaining a slight advantage in the most innovative and high-impact areas of this technology. This contrast\u2014China\u2019s leadership in the more market-ready quantum sensing and quantum communications versus its lag in the less mature quantum computing\u2014illustrates its strength in swiftly refining and applying existing research, as well as its limitations in foundational innovation. China\u2019s strategic focus on near-term, commercially viable technologies reflects a pragmatic approach to innovation, prioritizing immediate gains over the deeper, longer-term breakthroughs that are expected to drive the future of the quantum economy. China is fully aware of its strengths and plays to them. The Chinese government has proposed investments exceeding $15 billion, far outpacing the United States, which has allocated around $3.8 billion. At the core of China\u2019s quantum innovation strategy is a relentless focus on translating cutting-edge research into practical, commercial applications. Government initiatives have created specialized hubs such as Hefei\u2019s \u201cQuantum Avenue,\u201d where academic research is seamlessly converted into market-ready technologies. These hubs not only foster innovation, but also ensure that technological advancements align with China\u2019s broader strategic goals, particularly in enhancing national security and economic competitiveness. Biopharmaceuticals The United States remains the world\u2019s biotechnology leader, with the highest level of new drug development. But this leadership position is at risk, particularly from China. The Chinese government has prioritized the development of the biopharmaceutical industry. China\u2019s biopharmaceutical industry is starting to show signs of innovation, including a surge in the volume and quality of biotech-related scientific publications, a rise in the number of novel Chinese drugs and out-licensing deals from Chinese biotech companies, particularly in oncology, and an increase in clinical trials taking place in China. [231] Chinese institutions are producing an increasing number of top-cited biotechnology-related publications. In 2012, they published 139 biotech papers in the top 10 percent of most-cited publications. By 2022, that number had surged to 671 top-cited papers, an increase of more than 382 percent. [232] China has also made significant strides in turning its scientific publications into biotechnology patents. The PCT, which entered force in 1978, allows innovators to seek protection for an invention simultaneously in each of a large number of countries through an \u201cinternational\u201d patent application. [233] From 2013 to 2023, the number of biotech PCT patents awarded to Chinese entities increased by more than 720 percent, from 266 to 1,920, exceeding the European Union\u2019s annual number starting in 2021. [234] China\u2019s biopharmaceutical industry is starting to show signs of innovation, including a surge in the volume and quality of biotech-related scientific publications, a rise in the number of novel Chinese drugs and out-licensing deals from Chinese biotech companies. According to a November 2023 McKinsey BioCentury report, China evinces increasing numbers of out-licensing deals, suggesting multinational corporations have growing confidence in the quality of Chinese biotech products. This number more than doubled from 15 in 2019 to 33 in 2023. [235] The largest rise has been in oncology, which experienced a nearly fourfold increase from 7 out-licensing deals in 2019 to 27 in 2023. [236] In 2023, China had five first-in-class domestic drug approvals, a sign that domestic innovation is increasing. The five drugs approved were Glumetinib (Haihe Biopharma), Leritrelvir (Raynovent), Anaprazole (Xuanzhu Biopharma), Pegol-Sihematide (Hansoh Pharma), and Zuberitamab (BioRay Biopharmaceutical). [237] Also in 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved three new Chinese drugs: Loqtorzi (toripalimab), the first FDA-approved drug for nasopharyngeal cancer, Fruzaqla (fruquintinib) for metastatic colorectal cancer, and Ryzneuta (efbemalenograstim) for the treatment of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia. [238] In recent years, China has focused on developing novel drug types, including monoclonal and CAR-T cell products, which show promise in cancer immunotherapy. China\u2019s biopharmaceutical industry is starting to show signs of innovation. [239] Beyond drugs, the industry is also making advances in multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests, which involve the application of genome sequencing techniques to detect common cancer features in the blood. Through the Chinese government\u2019s support, MCED developers can access state capital, academic biobanks, and other resources. This gives them an advantage over their American counterparts, which do not have access to the same resources and thus have to rely heavily on private sector investment to obtain them. The Chinese biotech industry\u2019s focus on oncology\u2014as evidenced by its novel drugs, out-licensing deals, and diagnostic tests in this therapeutic area\u2014is relatively new, and motivated in large part by China\u2019s aging population and the rising incidence of cancer. Previously, its domestic biopharmaceutical industry focused on bringing down infectious disease rates, leading China to become the global leader in penicillin. As the mortality rates from infectious diseases fell, China\u2019s focus shifted to chronic diseases, such as cancer, seizing an opportunity to develop treatments for these diseases at lower cost structures. [240] But despite China\u2019s biotechnology advances, the country still faces several challenges. Many Chinese start-ups have been and continue to be founded by scientists, which presents difficulties for commercialization, as scientific research ability is very different from commercial transformation ability. Reflecting on the state of technology entrepreneurship in China, Marina Tue Zhang, Mark Dodgson, and David M. Gann wrote in their 2021 book, Demystifying China\u2019s Innovation Machine : There is a long distance from lab to hospital and pharmacy. Supportive policy, capital, and experienced managers are needed to make it, which also depend on mature ecosystems that China does not possess. The United States, on the other hand, has a sophisticated biopharmaceutical ecosystem, not only in life science R&D but also in the commercialization of biotechnology and bioengineering breakthroughs, and in strong IP protection. [241] For China to become a global biotech leader, it will be critical for it to build comprehensive ecosystems, which include greater enforcement of IP rights, the ethical use of technologies such as gene editing, and technology transfer from research to industry to enhance commercialization capabilities. [242] The Contrasting Western and Chinese Economic Models Economist Larry Summers once stated, \u201cThe laws of economics are like the laws of engineering. One set of laws works everywhere.\u201d [243] It is this widely held notion that has led many experts and policymakers to dismiss the threat from Chinese techno-economic policies. For them, since there is only one law of economics, China must be like us\u2014or at least working to become so, especially if we teach them\u2014and so China will eventually structure its economic policy to focus on consumer welfare generated through free markets. To the extent China now violates those universal laws, it\u2019s China\u2019s economy that suffers, not ours\u2019. Because the Chinese economic and innovation system does not comport to the U.S. system, it\u2019s easy for so many to dismiss the China challenge. Experts endlessly repeat such statements as China is wasting money; China\u2019s growth is not sustainable; and, of course, China is not innovative. The first two are irrelevant, and the last is false. China\u2019s Dream: Techno-Economic Leadership If China were trying to achieve the Western economics goal of allocation efficiency (the market-based allocation of goods, services, and investments), Western economies would have little to worry about, because as a rising economy, its innovation capabilities would be limited. Chinese leaders and experts do understand the Western economic model and know that, according to it, China should accept developing-nation status. China\u2019s economists have read The Wealth of Nations . They attend conferences where neoclassical economists tout the importance of free markets and consumer welfare. But they don\u2019t care because the CCP wants something completely different. Chinese leaders are not seeking to maximize short-term consumer welfare or even to provide good jobs for Chinese workers. The CCP, especially under President Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership, is focused first and foremost on maximizing global techno-economic power, including through an array of predatory mercantilist policies whose principal focus is on growing China\u2019s advanced economy at the expense of the rest of the global economy, especially Western technology leaders. As the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a branch of the Ministry of State Security, stated, \u201cEconomic growth is a prerequisite to and a necessary foundation for the rise of a great power.\u201d [244] But it is not just any kind of economic growth China is seeking; it is advanced manufacturing. As a Chinese report titled \u201cGeneral Laws of the Rise of Great Powers\u201d states, \u201cManufacturing can Rejuvenate a Nation \u2026\u200d For a modern economy to be prosperous and strong it requires a powerful, diversified, and creative manufacturing industry\u2026. Becoming a major manufacturing power provides crucial security for the goal of realizing the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation.\u201d [245] Similarly, Wen Yi, a professor at Tsinghua University, has argued, \u201cSo long as a nation steps out onto the road of Industrial Revolution and becomes the factory of the world, it has the possibility of becoming the world leader in technological innovation. But if an industrialized nation abandons its manufacturing industry, it will very likely come by degrees to lose its technological advantage and capacity for innovation.\u201d [246] Similarly, the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations wrote, \u201cThe state that esteems industry will increase in wisdom day by day.\u201d [247] The opposite is also true, as we see in the United States. The state that is indifferent to or even dismissive of industry will decrease in wisdom day by day. [248] As Tanner Greer and Nancy Yu wrote: Xi explained the logic behind [this] to a gathering of Chinese scientists held [in 2016]\u2026 He argued that \u201chistorical experience shows that [these] technological revolutions profoundly change the global development pattern.\u201d \u2026 Some states \u201cseize\u201d this \u201crare opportunity.\u201d Others do not. Those who recognize the revolution before them and actively take advantage of it \u201crapidly increase their economic strength, scientific and technological strength, and defense capabilities, thereby quickly enhancing their composite national strength.\u201d [249] As such, China\u2019s economic, trade, and technology policy is all about gaining relative global power through advanced industry leadership. Chinese economic policy, unlike American, does not privilege consumer welfare. And it is OK with wasting money; efficiency is not its top goal. Likewise, Chinese leaders do not care about \u201cdistorting the market\u201d; in fact, the only way China can become the global leader is to distort the market, because otherwise market forces would suggest that China remain a low-wage manufacturer for many decades to come. China is focused first and foremost on maximizing global techno-economic power through an array of predatory mercantilist policies whose principal focus is on growing its advanced economy at the expense of the rest of the global economy, especially the technology leaders. Consider the term \u201cdomination.\u201d For China, domination does not come from cooperation or global market specialization along Ricardian lines (i.e., nations prospering by leveraging their distinct comparative advantages); it comes from battle. As such, Yi Changliang, a leading official of China\u2019s NDRC, wrote, \u201cAt a time when this new round of techno-scientific revolution and industrial transformation has not yet gained its [full] momentum, there are grand expectations for artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing and [these areas] have become the main battlefield for innovation.\u201d [250] In other words, the CCP sees economics, trade, and technology as a battlefield on which to fight for dominance. This is so vastly far from how Western economics views international economics that very few economists, policymakers, or elected officials understand it or take it seriously. After all, they believe what Larry Summers believes. [251] China is focused first and foremost on maximizing global techno-economic power. [252] And as China advances, the CCP sees and hopes that America is retreating. As Xie Tao, dean of the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University, wrote, \u201cAll tides that rise must fall. All living men must age, sicken, and die. Therefore, the United States must accept that the day will come where it too will fall into decline.\u201d [253] Likewise, the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations wrote about the United States turning its back on globalization: \u201cThe reversal of the open-door policy is another step down the road to America losing its status as a great power.\u201d [254] China is engaged in a battle to win the war for global techno-economic power. An article by Suchodolski, Harrison, Heiden talks about \u201cinnovation warfare\u201d: Improving the living conditions of one\u2019s citizens is a justifiable and laudable goal. However, especially savvy nation states, such as China, also pursue such ends as a mechanism to influence or diminish the national security and geopolitical power of the United States. These actions also threaten the post-WWII liberal economic order and worldwide peace and security. There is no need to inflict upon the world the carnage of war if geopolitical aims can be achieved via alternative competitive means. [255] Finally, it\u2019s important to come back to the Chinese term \u201cGreat Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation,\u201d which President Xi Jinping regularly touts. Is this just increasing per capita income growth, or something more? As the Center for Strategic Translation has argued, one aim associated with China\u2019s National Rejuvenation is for \u201cChina\u2019s return to national greatness as a process of \u2018advancing toward the center for the world stage.\u2019\u201d They quoted an official Xinhua commentary on the 19th Congress of what this advance entails: China has stood up, grown rich and become strong. It will advance toward center stage and make greater contributions for mankind. By 2050, two centuries after the Opium Wars, which plunged the \u201cMiddle Kingdom\u201d into a period of hurt and shame, China is set to regain its might and re-ascend to the top of the world\u2026. China\u2019s success proves that socialism can prevail and be a path for other developing countries to emulate and achieve modernization. China is now strong enough, willing, and able to contribute more for mankind. The new world order cannot be just dominated by capitalism and the West, and the time will come for a change. [256] At the very least, Western policymakers should take seriously the possibility that China is seeking not just growth, not just gradual development, and not just technological advancement according to Ricardian principles; but rather global dominance in advanced industries, which it sees as a source of power. The CCP sees economics, trade, and technology as a battlefield on which to fight for dominance. This is so vastly far from how Western economics views international economics that very few economists, policymakers, or elected officials understand it or take it seriously. American Neglect Unfortunately, few in America recognize that the United States is even in such a competition. To the extent U.S. leaders pay attention, they myopically focus on limiting Chinese military capabilities, thinking that is the main threat to American global leadership, and go out of their way to assure CCP leaders that export controls and other limitations are only for weapons systems. Even worse, many leaders in Europe selfishly portray this as a trade war between China and the United States, which the United States instigated to keep its power; not a conflict between China and the West that China instigated. This way, EU governments hope their firms can sweep in and take U.S. market share as it kowtows to Beijing. One reason for this lassitude is most U.S. (and EU) economists and international trade think tanks see economic interchange as a win-win, based on Ricardian comparative advantage and specialization generated by market forces. Not China. It sees this as a war wherein there will be winners and losers, and they intend to be the winner and make the West into the loser. To be sure, this framing as techno-economic war is seen as extremist in the West because of just how deeply engrained the 200-year-old economics of trade and market-based allocation focus has become. Indeed, U.S. economic pundits have long scoffed at the very notion that America even competes with other nations. For them, only economic illiterates believe this. Indeed, as one DOC official stated during the Obama Administration when talking to an expert group to advise DOC on developing a national competitiveness strategy, \u201cIt seems wrong for us to try to compete with other nations. After all, we don\u2019t want to hurt them.\u201d [257] To paraphrase Trotsky, you may not be interested in techno-econ war, but techno-econ war is interested in you. Imagine going to war when thinking that the enemy is both fighting and wanting to cooperate\u2014and to the extent they are not cooperating, you think that it is they who will suffer. That is the idea that dominates too much of American and European thinking. Even if some recognize that China has a different set of goals than Western nations do, many fail to take China seriously because they have bought into the increasingly fashionable claim that China\u2019s techno-economic policies are now simply to achieve self-sufficiency in the face of U.S. export controls and other measures to restrict China\u2019s access to technology. [258] Of course, China is seeking to reduce dependence in the short run, but its goal for many years before export controls has been to reverse dependence and make the Western nations dependent on China. It is the failure to recognize that Summers is wrong and there are two very different economic systems with different rules that is the core problem for the West. The West sees national economies as not in conflict, but rather with specialization based on comparative advantage generating win-win outcomes. China sees competition as akin to war. As Xi Jinping stated, \u201cTechnological innovation has become the main battleground of the global playing field, and competition for tech dominance will grow unprecedentedly fierce.\u201d [259] It is the failure to recognize that there are two completely different economic systems with different rules that is the core problem for the West. Thus, the key issue is not about whether the Chinese system fits the Western system or even if the Western system can be improved within its intellectual confines. The key issue is whether the Western or Chinese system is superior. Surprisingly, Xi Jinping admitted as much when he stated to a CCP gathering, \u201cInstitutional/System advantage is a country\u2019s greatest advantage, institutional/system competition is the most fundamental competition between countries.\u201d [260] We should take him at his word. When Chinese officials talk to the West about win-win, moving to consumer-led growth, how the United States is trying to hold back China, or how it was the United States that started the trade war, we should not take them seriously. And it is amazing that so many outside China do. They are spinning propaganda. But when Xi talks about system competition, we do need to take him deadly seriously. He means it. He is arguing that the very techno-economic system China has constructed is their main advantage against the West\u2014and in many ways he is correct. Rather than reflectively dismiss the Chinese system as ineffective or even harmful, or to judge it on the basis of U.S. goals (allocation efficiency), the real question to ask is, \u201cWhat system is superior when it comes to winning the global techno-economic war?\u201d In China\u2019s conception, there are winners and losers, and the CCP wants to be the winner. And the way to win is to build up weapons (globally leading firms) and use them to destroy one\u2019s enemies (Western nations\u2019 advanced industry firms). At minimum, it is time for Western nations\u2019 experts and policymakers to open their minds and at least have a considered dialogue and debate about this point, rather than hide their heads in the sand and ignore China\u2019s aims and fall back on the inherent superiority of Adam Smith\u2019s and David Ricardo\u2019s classical economics model for free markets and free trade, especially the notion of all countries gaining from trade based on their comparative advantage. Chinese and U.S. Economic Systems As such, the U.S. (and Western) systems and China\u2019s are fundamentally different. (see Table 1). Most Western nations\u2019 comparative advantage is based on market forces. If the United States loses an industry, such as telecom equipment, it\u2019s because we no longer have natural comparative advantage and have moved on to other, inherently superior, activities. Indeed, no loss of technologies and industries can be problematic, because, by definition, their loss is always ordained by market forces and replaced by something superior. In contrast, China, as noted, seeks to win the global war for advanced technology leadership by supporting key firms in key industries, while attempting to reduce the market share of foreign competitors. For most Western nations, especially outside Asia, the goal is consumer and taxpayer welfare. For example, tariffs are decried because they raise prices for consumers\u2014a cardinal sin. For China, closed markets are a key industrial policy tool. In the United States, because they might waste taxpayer dollars, subsidies are decried, unless they are for \u201cgreen industries.\u201d For China, they are just a cost of doing business. American experts favor a strong dollar because it is good for U.S. consumers (but bad for producers). The CCP favors a weak RMB because it\u2019s good for their producers and bad for foreign producers. In China, large firms are supported because they can win the global battle, even if higher prices domestically might result. In the United States, competition, and now \u201cantimonopoly\u201d (a reflective anticorporate doctrine) is privileged because today\u2019s consumers and workers might benefit. Rather than reflectively dismiss the Chinese system as ineffective or even harmful, or to judge it on the basis of U.S. goals (allocation efficiency), the real question to ask is, \u201cWhat system is superior when it comes to winning the global techno-economic war?\u201d Because most U.S. economists and pundits look at China through the American free market lens, they fail to see what China is actually doing. They look at China\u2019s overcapacity (producing more than a short-term, profit-maximizing firm would produce) as a failure of Chinese economic policy, something Chinese policymakers would fix if only they better understood economics. As former director of President Biden\u2019s National Economic Council, Brian Deese, wrote: China confronts an economic dilemma of lagging growth, low consumption and an elevated savings rate. This is partly the result of its highly unequal economy, in which workers are paid a smaller share of what they produce than in most maturing economies. A shift toward policies that support domestic demand, such as expanding the social safety net or even direct payments to households alongside more progressive taxation, could reduce inequality, increase consumption and support more sustainable economic growth. But instead, Beijing announced at its National Party Congress last month that it would ramp up investment in advanced manufacturing to export products overseas. [261] Deese, like so many, is judging China\u2019s economic policies through a Western lens. China sees greater domestic demand and consumer spending as reducing needed investment. It sees increased exports as an important weapon for having its firms lead the world. Exported overcapacity is a weapon, equivalent to a cruise missile launched to destroy an enemy installation. For the West, free trade is ideal and any deviation from it is a problem. It is ideal because it is only though market processes that optimal exchanges can take place, which by definition benefit buyer and seller. In contrast, China practices \u201cpower trade,\u201d wherein it uses trade policy to strengthen its own producers and weaken foreign ones, and thereby create foreign dependencies on China. [262] When it comes to advancing technological innovation, the West\u2019s model is a linear one, in which the only appropriate role for government is investing in basic research that academics are interested in, an area economists argue the private sector will largely neglect. But this is the kind of research that has the most global spillovers, including to China. The Chinese model is to fund whatever research will help Chinese firms gain competitive advantage, especially applied R&D, which is more easily retained in China. As Yi Changliang noted, \u201c[We must] guide scientific research institutions and universities to focus closely on the major scientific research tasks [prioritized by the government] and effectively integrate and optimize scientific research resources.\u201d [263] The West\u2019s economic system is built around consumption, perhaps because of the almost permanent legacy of the trauma of the Great Depression and the imbedded, but faulty, Keynesian thinking that economies naturally gravitate to underconsumption. This is why almost all government spending and tax cuts are justified by claiming they will boost jobs (even when the economy is at full employment) and why automation is opposed by so many. U.S. policy is focused on jobs; Chinese policy is focused on creating globally powerful firms. For China, the fact that consumer spending constitutes a much smaller share of its GDP is seen as a sacrifice that Chinese consumers make to ensure that the economy grows and becomes powerful. But Macroeconomics 101 teaches that more spending does not create jobs unless the economy is in recession, which it usually is not. China doesn\u2019t care about consumption. It cares about investment; spending that generates a larger economy a decade from when it is made. For China, the fact that consumer spending constitutes a much smaller share of its GDP is seen as a sacrifice that Chinese consumers must make to ensure that the economy grows and becomes powerful. In the United States, there is alarm and finger pointing if the share of GDP going to consumers drops even 1 percentage point, because all that matters is short-term individual welfare, not the greater good of the nation in the medium and long term. Moreover, there is no direction for Western economies, with perhaps the exception of getting larger (or smaller if you listen to the growing number of climate activists who tout \u201cdegrowth\u201d). The very idea that the state would have interest in moving the economy in a certain direction is scoffed at. What could a bunch of pointy-headed bureaucrats know about the economy compared with the tens of millions of consumers and businesses making decisions on a minute-by-minute basis on what to buy and sell? Whatever structure of the economy emerges from this almost magical and holy process is the optimal one, albeit nowadays with the one exception now of climate pollution. But even for this, their answer is carbon taxes so economic actors\u2019 decisions take carbon pollution into account. In contrast, the CCP knows the direction it wants its economy to move in. It wants to be more innovative, and it wants a greater global share of advanced technology production in key industries (e.g., AI, aerospace, robotics, etc.) even if this is \u201cinefficient.\u201d Building aircraft carriers and fighter jets is also inefficient, but Western nations do it because they know they need to for national power. This relates to the issue of industrial policy and \u201cpicking winners.\u201d In the West, and especially in Anglo-American countries, it is verboten to argue that an industry is more important than any other, except perhaps nowadays with green tech industries and computer chips (the latter only because China might invade Taiwan). [264] This is why the notion of \u201ccomputers chips, potato chips\u2014what\u2019s the difference?\u201d is still held by most economists. And this is why when the former head of a leading international trade think tank was asked how much manufacturing America could lose and still be OK, he said, \u201cAll of it.\u201d [265] No reason to have manufacturing. Services are fine. Yet, in China, power comes not only from the end of a gun but from the end of an assembly line. The last thing China would want is to evolve into a services economy, even if doing so somehow led to higher living standards. China looks at investing in advanced technology industries the way the West looks at investing in military weapons systems. Economic returns are not the goal; power and security are. The two systems also differ in their orientation to capital investment. The Western model is to not invest unless the net present value return of an investment equals or exceeds the cost of capital, especially in the short term. In this model, the risk of overinvestment is as serious as the risk of underinvestment. [266] There are some exceptions to this, particularly spending for national defense. Yet, few, if any, judge military weapons spending on the basis of overall economic rate of return. Rather, policymakers invest in weapons based on the amount needed to keep the nation secure. China looks at investing in advanced technology industries the way the West looks at investing in military weapons systems. Economic returns are not the goal; power and security are. Finally, politics. The U.S. political system has always been, since its founding, one in which various interests and factions press to advance their interests. But it has also always been a system in which factions, under determined and visionary leadership, can and do regularly coalesce around the national interest, suppressing at least to some extent and some degree parochial interests. America did that most recently throughout the Cold War. Alas, those days appear to be long gone. With the threat of Soviet domination long in the rear-view mirror, replaced with a triumphalist \u201cend of history\u201d view, America now appears to be nothing more than warring factions and tribes, each one proclaiming their goodness and others\u2019 villainy, and with neither side focused on international advanced industry competitiveness. In the United States, individual interests vie for benefit. Unions want better jobs and more worker voice. Consumer groups want cheaper prices today. Small business wants lower taxes and fewer regulations. Wall Street wants a strong dollar and an even more financialized economy. Civil society groups want more followers and foundation money. The legal profession wants more litigation. Environmental groups want less pollution. Who wants a strong nation, especially if that requires giving up something? Can you imagine a president stating that U.S. trade policy will deemphasize industries not related to U.S. strategic interests, such as agriculture, financial services, low-wage manufacturing, and natural resources, and instead give priority to advanced industries? Hard to imagine. Not only would the economics pundits scream that potato chips are equal to computer chips, but Congress would immediately intervene to defend local industry interests. In China, parochial interests are relegated to the CCP\u2019s overall goal of advancing technologically and winning the techno-economic war. The July 2024 \u201cResolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening of Reform to Comprehensively Advanced Chinese Modernization\u201d states that it will establish mechanisms for major industrial investment funds to be \u201cchallenged to our country\u2019s strategic needs \u201d (emphasis added). [267] With the threat of Soviet domination long in the rear-view mirror, replaced with a triumphalist \u201cend of history\u201d view, America now appears to be nothing more than warring factions and tribes ... with neither side focused on growth and competitiveness. Imagine during WWII if the United States had put consumer interests first and not imposed gas or tire rationing because consumers complained. Or if Ford and GM lobbied successfully to not convert to weapons production. Or if unions were told they could engage in unlimited strikes. America\u2019s leaders did not do that, and most interests accepted that because they understood that the national interest to defeat the Axis powers trumped self-interest. That is the spirit we need to have today in America to win the techno-economic war with China. Business used to be able to speak with one voice in the 1960s and 1970s, with groups such as the Business Roundtable and business statesmen such as Irving Shapiro of Dupont and Reg Jones of GE speaking not only for their own companies but for the U.S. capitalist system and the overall nation. We seldom see that anymore. In his book Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy , Bill Janeway discussed how America had national missions from its founding: the Hamiltonian mission of building the country to be independent of England; the mission from Lincoln to FDR to become a great world power and ty the country together; and the post-World War II Soviet containment mission. [268] But today, America no longer has a unifying national mission that interests can rally around other than freedom for the Right, equity and redistribution for the Left (and the so-called \u201cnew Right\u201d), and fighting climate change for many. Self-interest not only runs amok, but has become the new civic religion. China has a national mission: to make China the most powerful country in the world. The CCP works to align most activities to make that happen. And that gives China an advantage in catching up. Before we hear the cries that ITIF wants to turn the United States into an authoritarian dictatorship: No, we do not. But we do believe that there is a middle ground between the CCP\u2019s authoritarianism and the every-person-for-themself principle that now characterizes U.S. politics and society. We used to be able to attain that balance, but we have lost it. Table 4 compares the Chinese and U.S. systems. Table 4: U.S. and Chinese economic systems U.S. System Chinese System Overarching goal Enable comparative advantage based on market forces Win the global war for advanced technology leadership Immediate goal Consumer welfare (or worker welfare for the Left) National power Process Allocation efficiency Dynamic and productive efficiency Types of trade Free trade (or protectionism for the Left and new Republicans) Power trade Tool for tech progress Fund basic science Fund indigenous technology advancement Rationale for investment Invest for rate of return Invest for market share Means Consumption (to keep full employment) Investment Technology No direction To lead in advanced technology Focus on industry Sectoral indifference Strategic interests Politics Aggregation of competing private interests National interests There is a middle ground between CCP\u2019s authoritarianism and the every-person-for-themself principle that now characterizes U.S. politics and society. We used to be able to attain that balance, but we have lost it. To be sure, the U.S. government has moved somewhat in this direction, particularly with the passage of the CHIPS Act. But that is best seen as a one-off effort, largely justified on national security grounds. It does not appear that this is a precursor to a more robust national industrial strategy to ensure continued U.S. global power, given both the unwillingness to cut spending and raise taxes to support true investment and because of the failure of U.S. leadership to embrace a new, \u201cproducerist\u201d economic policy doctrine. Contrasting Innovation Policy Systems To achieve its goal of techno-economic power, China has built a different kind of innovation system, perhaps the first of its kind in the world. Most in the West, particularly the Anglo-American sphere, remain in denial of this reality, holding onto a historically unique conception of innovation, one which, when pared against the new Chinese model, is now seriously deficient. Just as the United States put in place a new innovation model beginning in the late 1940s (and adapted it in the 1980s and early 1990s to respond to the Japanese challenge), it is time to do this again, adopting what we call a \u201cnational power capitalism\u201d model of innovation and production, wherein the role of the state is much more active and supportive of winning the techno-economic war with China. The U.S. Innovation System The U.S. archetypal model of innovation, first articulated in 1945 by MIT engineer and president Vannevar Bush, is the following: Government invests in basic science at universities and government labs, with the research projects selected by principal investigators following their own interests or by agencies pursuing national interests such as defense, space exploration, health, or energy. At some point, through some undescribed process, the knowledge generated is used by entrepreneurs located in the United States. Vannevar Bush [269] These entrepreneurs, while not plentiful, constitute a core part of the American system because U.S. culture, education, and immigration policy support individuals who think outside the box and want to take risks to disrupt industries. These heroic and creative individuals\u2014such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Mark Zuckerberg, and Elon Musk\u2014blend scientific results with other ingredients to develop something brand new (the PC operating system, the smartphone, e-commerce, the search engine, social networks, EVs, etc.). And because of our free markets, limited taxation, and robust IP protection system, they can reap the rewards of their innovations while their products are able to compete fairly in the marketplace. For over at least 75 years, that has been the story Americans have told themselves about the U.S. innovation system\u2014and because the United States has largely succeeded, at least until the last couple decades, few question that mythic narrative. Indeed, it is still held by most to be the archetypal innovation system, with all others being pale substitutes at best. As we will discuss, it is that intellectual commitment to the current U.S. national innovation system that is one of the biggest barriers that need to change. To be clear, the above, including robust IP protections, are a strength, but they are no longer enough. In fact, this a very appealing and comforting story, and one that plays to America\u2019s strengths. We do have the best research universities in the world, even if funding levels have stagnated and China is gaining. We do have perhaps the most entrepreneurial workforce, and a high level of creativity and individuality. And compared with most economies, we do have free markets, light-touch regulation (at least until recently), and not onerously high business taxes. Given that we have the best innovation system in the world\u2014or at least we tell ourselves that we do\u2014America should be dominating other nations on innovation, especially a communist, Confucian, conformist nation such as China, whose basic science is relatively weak, although improving. China squashes, rather than supports, free thinking. And it does not let markets alone drive development. Yet, we are not dominating, at least not as much as we did. As noted, in 2020, China had a higher share of advanced industry output as a share of GDP in 7 of 10 industries than the United States did, with the United States leading in only biopharmaceuticals, other transportation (e.g., aerospace), and software and information services. And China runs a trade surplus in advanced technology products, while the United States runs a large trade deficit. [270] And as this report shows, China leads or is on par with the United States in innovation in a few industries, including EVs and nuclear power; is making significantly faster progress in a host of other industries, including robotics, chemicals, and biotechnology; and is making progress in AI, quantum, and semiconductors. In many industries, we can expect China to catch up in innovation within just a decade or so. Just as the United States put in place a new innovation model beginning in the late 1940s (and adapted it in the 1980s and early 1990s), it is time to do this again, adopting a \u201cnational power capitalism\u201d model of innovation and production. According to the U.S. conception of innovation, this should not be possible. At best, China should be a copier, regularly a generation or two behind the Western leaders, copying products and services, and gaining market share on the basis of lower prices. To be sure, that was the Chinese model for decades, but what most fail to realize is that this has not been the stated model for China since 2006 when China set its sights on becoming a robust innovator, first on par with the Western nations and then ultimately to lead. Given that, according to the Western innovation playbook, America should be leading and China lagging behind, how can its system succeed when it is not structured like ours? Perhaps a better question is how can our system succeed given the strengths of the Chinese model, as enumerated ahead? The U.S. system is based on generating scientific discoveries, but those are a public good that now are relatively easily copied and incorporated around the world. A half century ago, U.S. science was of almost no value to China because it had few scientists and engineers who could use such knowledge. Almost all the value went to the United States. But today, China has many more scientists than America does. Moreover, before the Internet, scientific information was hard to access. Today it is easy. Our system is based on inventions by heroic entrepreneurs, but invention is also easily copied. Once an original, even radical idea is in the marketplace, it can be copied and reverse engineered, especially by a system that does not respect IP rights. Take nuclear power. Virtually every system the Chinese are building and improving on is based on inventions the United States made in the 1950s and 1960s but abandoned because of the lack of will to invest in building nuclear power plants. And these technologies were relatively easy to learn. Chinese nuclear scientists could read U.S. government reports from the era. They could and did visit our labs. Indeed, remarkably, Chinese researchers formed the largest category of international visitors to Oak Ridge national lab from 2007 to 2015. [271] This was something the U.S. Department of Energy astonishingly encouraged because they wanted the Chinese to have commercial nuclear power. What the U.S. model fails to fully incorporate is just how much work, improvement, and innovation must be achieved to take an invention to full production. It\u2019s a bit like an iceberg: 90 percent of the work is underwater and comes after the headline-making invention. The United States excels at the 10 percent of invention, but often lags behind at the 90 percent of innovation and production. The reality is that much innovation is about iterative experimenting and tweaking. Edison understood this when he said, \u201cGenius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.\u201d James Bessen wrote in Learning by Doing that \u201cknowledge and a long string of improvements follow for decades after the invention, continually altering the technology and skills needed.\u201d [272] In this sense, the U.S. model focuses on invention; the Chinese on continuous innovation and production. The U.S. system is based on generating scientific discoveries, but those are a public good that now are easily copied and incorporated around the world. The U.S. system is based on incentives for entrepreneurs and free markets in which they can sell their products. But incentives to make money cut both ways. The strongest incentives in the U.S. system are for the best and brightest to become glorified casino operators: financial traders who make a fortune manipulating markets and getting a millisecond edge on other traders, all the while adding virtually no value to the economy. And even when the incentives align to create something of real value, the incentives are often for discovery, not production. Witness the number of U.S. tech entrepreneurs more than happy to cash out by selling their companies to deep-pocketed Chinese companies. Moreover, there is plenty of money to be made in tech areas only tangentially related to national power and strength, such as cryptocurrency. The incentives for investing in deep tech (high-tech innovation in engineering or significant scientific advances) or hard tech (innovations in atom-based industries) are much weaker. This is one of the reasons for the establishment by the Pentagon of the Defense Innovation Unit to support entrepreneurial companies working in areas beyond software. Finally, the U.S. system is based on a linear model based on the following: discover > invent > innovate > produce > go offshore, go bankrupt, or hopefully continue until broken up by trust busters > new discovery, new invention > invent, etc. (See figure 23.) Scientists discover knowledge, which can sometimes lead to something being invented if the knowledge is actually useable and transferred over the first \u201cvalley of death\u201d to a domestic entrepreneur or business. That company must be able to move from prototype to full production (getting over the second valley of death). Once it does that, it hopefully expands production in the United States. But all too often, if these technologies make it over the valleys of death, they are produced overseas. Or if they do enter production in the United States, they often fail to achieve commercial success, either because of foreign competition, often unfair in nature, or because of equity market pressures for companies to go \u201casset-light\u201d and achieve short-term returns that limit adequate capitalization to achieve globally competitive scale and cost competitiveness. Or, as has been the regular practice for over 75 years, overly zealous U.S. antitrust officials bludgeon successful companies into small bits, later to die from lack of scale vis-\u00e0-vis foreign competitors\u2014as they did with RCA, Xerox, AT&T, and IBM\u2014and now are trying to do with leading tech companies such as Google. [273] But not to worry, we are told: The new cycle repeats itself. In fact, for some, such as Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Kahn, the faster we get rid of the large innovators, the faster U.S. innovation will be. If this were not such a tragic framing, it would be laughable. The strongest incentives in the U.S. system are for the best and brightest to become glorified casino operators: financial traders who make a fortune manipulating markets and getting a millisecond edge on other traders, all the while adding virtually no value to the economy. Fundamentally, the U.S. innovation system is a process-based one. Support antitrust enforcement and privilege competition. Support research funding. Support light-touch regulation. Support high-skill immigration. Build more infrastructure. If these processes are robust, the results will be robust. While this is no longer true, even if it were, the results do not guarantee that the United States will maintain the needed strengths in the key areas China is targeting for dominance, such as semiconductors, biotech, and aerospace. Moreover, this ingrained belief in the superiority of the U.S. system is why most U.S. technology policy proposals focus not on changing this linear process, but rather on optimizing it. Not enough discovery? Fund more science. But scientists and engineers in many countries now attend international academic conferences at which U.S. scientists appear and read the scientific journals they publish in. Science is now a much more public (i.e., international) good than it was when Vannevar Bush advised President Truman to establish the National Science Foundation (NSF). Not enough transfer of discoveries over the first valley of death? Provide more incentives to universities and federal labs to transfer and commercialize the results of their research while making it easier for entrepreneurs to utilize this research (e.g., provide R&D tax credits for start-ups, support seed and venture capital, etc.) And while you are at it, train more science, technology, education, and mathematics (STEM) workers and let more foreign STEM workers live in the United States. Support more entrepreneurs, including nontraditional ones. Ensure that entrepreneurs are free to commercialize and are not squashed by unfair competition from large companies. All good ideas, but none really address the issue of scale-up and economically sustainable production globally in the key industries China is targeting. The U.S. innovation system has also evolved over the last 30 to 40 years into an overwhelmingly top-down system, focused on the end product and the customer experience/demand, long ago abandoning many lower levels of the value chain. To be sure, in many tech areas, the end customer is the most profitable value chain segment. However, a robust national innovation system requires competencies up and down the value chain\u2014and it is far more difficult for the United States to move down the value chain than for China to move up. China engaged in a classic Clay Christensen attack from below and too many American companies succumbed by ignoring the bottom only for the top. Indeed, this is the essence of America\u2019s strategic dilemma, since innovation must occur at every level of the value chain, not just cutting-edge science and high-value customer-facing segments. The current model of U.S. invents-China produces at scale is no longer sustainable if America does not want a technologically hollowed out economy. To be sure, if invention is the goal, then it very well could be true that entrepreneurial market capitalism is the superior system. But if innovation at scale in key industries is the goal, then national power capitalism appears to be superior. The current model of U.S. invents-China produces at scale is no longer sustainable if America does not want a technologically hollowed out economy. Figure 23: The U.S. and Chinese innovation systems The Chinese Innovation System While the post-war U.S. national innovation model was never optimal, it was mostly effective\u2014until it came head-to-head with the new Chinese innovation model. China\u2019s model is fundamentally different than the U.S. model because it is based on a different goal\u2014gaining advantage while at the same time degrading the advantage of competitors\u2014leading to a virtuous cycle for its companies and a vicious cycle for their competitors. In particular, the advantage it seeks is not principally higher GDP per capita. It is relative national techno-economic strength. As China tech analyst Bill Wyman wrote, \u201cChina is most focused on hard technology with national security implications.\u201d [274] Similarly, U.C. San Diego Chinese tech policy experts Naughton, Xiao, and Xu wrote, \u201cChinese economic policy under Xi Jinping shifts the ultimate objective of technology and industry policies from economics to security.\u201d [275] An article in Qiushi, the website of the CCP Central Commitment Bimonthly, states: By seizing the rare opportunities offered by technological revolution and industrial transformation, some countries were able to rapidly build up their composite national strength and become world powers in one leap. At present, a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is gathering momentum, with key disruptive technological innovations giving rise to new industries and new forms of business. [276] China seeks to attain that goal with a fundamentally different innovation model: rather than being linear from birth to death, and then a new birth, China\u2019s model is more circular. It starts with an injection of an innovation from an established source. For China, this can involve direct stealing of foreign plans and data (either by cyber or physical spying), copying and reverse engineering foreign technology, forced technology transfer from companies seeking Chinese market access, and sometimes licensing of technology from the leaders. If invention is the goal, then it very well could be true that entrepreneurial market capitalism is the superior system. But if innovation at scale is the goal, then national power capitalism appears to be superior. Once that technology enters the Chinese system, a positive cycle begins. (See figure 23.) Chinese companies (often many more companies than will end up surviving) start to produce the innovation, usually at a lower level of quality and lower price point. But because of robust levels of state support, as well as an often protected domestic market, at least some firms expand production. As they do, the more successful firms usually engage in rigorous, continuous incremental product improvement. This is often coupled with deep process innovation (changes in how the product is made), again often supported by government. As sales expand, and weaker firms go out of business, in part because of reduction in government support and a tougher economic environment, economies of scale increase, leading to a virtuous cycle of reduced costs and more R&D. At the same time, the large Chinese market enables more customer feedback, which leads to more changes, leading to more sales, and more profits, etc. Profits are then reinvested in R&D (product and process) to help the companies attack more market segments where Western companies lead. All the while, the Chinese entrants erode sales of their foreign competitors (often the most profitable incremental sales where product development and production costs are fully amortized) leading the latter to often cut back on R&D or simply exit some segments, telling themselves that these are mature and \u201cdogs\u201d (in the vernacular of the Boston Consulting Group matrix). [277] No need to slog it out in this production war; just exit and move to high-value-added services and branding. Even better, sell out to the Chinese at a hefty premium (e.g., GE Appliances and Haier, Ingram Micro and HNA Group, Motorola Mobility and Huawei, IBM PCs and Lenovo, and Lexmark and Apex Technology). The short-term focus on U.S. equity markets, coupled with the intense pressure to only be in high-margin businesses, makes the Chinese strategy of buying foreign advanced tech firms at a price premium particularly effective. China\u2019s model is based on gaining advantage and degrading the advantage of competitors. [278] While this model of innovation might not get to radical \u201cSchumpeterian\u201d inventions, it can get to industry leadership in innovation and continuous improvement and increased global market share, which often weakens more innovative competitors. In contrast, the American/Western linear model of innovation depends largely on good science, risk-taking entrepreneurs, and global market access. This is why both large and small countries can be successful with it. But even with all the spending on research, there are not really all that many fundamental breakthroughs such as gene editing, quantum computing, or deep learning AI models. Breakthroughs are rare. Scaling up and incremental innovation are not. Moreover, breakthrough leaders do not always end up being the ultimate leaders. There is a long history of the market winners being the second and third entrants. [279] The Chinese circular model of innovation involves factors of success that are different from the U.S. model. These can be called the \u201c10 S\u2019s\u201d: 1. S cience and Engineering Capabilities 2. Head S tart 3. Market S ize 4. S peed 5. Local S uppliers 6. S ubsidies 7. Firm S ize 8. S pecialization 9. S pace 10. S trategy Let\u2019s examine each one in the context of China. 1. Science and Engineering Capabilities Without strong science and engineering talent, it would be very difficult for China to \u201cabsorb and redigest\u201d foreign innovations. Having a massive number of scientists and engineers lets Chinese companies throw talent at the problem of continuous improvement. Unlike the United States, which focuses on producing Ph.D. talent to generate new discoveries, China focuses on producing a large share of bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree science and engineering talent, which can work in companies to help incrementally improve innovation. As Chinese scholar Wang Xiaodong wrote, \u201cThe key variable for determining the course of China\u2019s future development is thus the massive number of talented technical and scientific workers.\u201d [280] For every U.S. R&D worker supported by $100,000 of R&D spend, a Chinese firm spending $100,000 on R&D can throw 2.3 workers at the problem. One reason for this is the cost of Chinese technical talent is significantly lower than in the United States, allowing Chinese companies to put many more researchers and engineers on problems than U.S. companies can. In this case, quantity has its own quality. Using EU R&D 2,500 data, we can see that the number of R&D workers per million dollars of R&D spend is much higher in China than in the United States. [281] For example, in a random sample of 16 Chinese and U.S. firms, the R&D-to-sales ratio is about the same, but the R&D-to-employee ratio is 2.3 times higher for Chinese firms than for U.S. firms. In other words, for every U.S. R&D worker supported by $100,000 of R&D spend, a Chinese firm spending $100,000 on R&D can throw 2.3 workers at the problem. Even as China has built up its own domestic capabilities, it continues to seek R&D capabilities from overseas, especially by attracting advanced industry and R&D facilities to China. The Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology recently wrote: Whether innovative resources can be efficiently allocated is an important consideration for foreign investors to set up R&D centers in China. Several measures are proposed to actively absorb qualified foreign R&D center science and technology experts into the national science and technology expert database and relevant local science and technology expert databases; improve the relevant work system for the transfer of intellectual property rights; provide quarantine approval facilitation arrangements; encourage overseas talents to apply for professional titles, etc. [282] The key word here is \u201cabsorb,\u201d as China sees foreign investment through only one lens: whether it can absorb into the broader Chinese innovation ecosystem the capabilities and knowledge foreign firms can provide. 2. Head Start China has achieved a head start in certain industries, and because of this, it has been able to tip the balance decisively in favor of its companies that are far down industry learning curves and have achieved decisive scale economies, enabling them to produce products\u2014if not as innovative as Western ones, then at a much lower price point. This is related to the traditional infant industries argument, where it can be difficult for countries to enter industries with declining marginal costs if the leader has a head start. In cases where China has been able to get out in front, its comparative advantage can be almost insurmountable. We see the potential for going forward in drones and nuclear power where China is at least 10 years ahead of the United States; and now with EVs, where because of government policy, demand for EVs in China was at least a decade ahead of other nations. We may see it in the future with industries such as humanoid robots and potentially quantum computing. China has achieved a head start in certain industries, and because of this, it was able to tip the balance decisively in favor of its companies that are far down industry learning curves and have achieved decisive scale economies. 3. Market Size Related to getting a head start, which vaults the Chinese companies ahead of their competitors, in many industries, China either has caught up (telecom equipment, batteries, and EVs) or is rapidly catching up (robotics and chemicals) by achieving significant economies of scale and learning. Economies of scale mean that the marginal cost of every additional unit is lower than the prior unit. Learning or experience curves mean that companies learn how to produce better products and produce the same product better as they produce more. As the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations wrote, \u201cOnce a population of 1.3 billion people has grown wealthy, the result will be a supersized marketplace.\u201d [283] China understands this, which is why it usually shuts its markets to foreign companies when it has its own capabilities, and why it has put so many resources into its Belt and Road Initiative. [284] China\u2019s strategy seeks to achieve scale by ensuring a large market. China does this through a variety of means. As the second-largest economy in terms of GDP and the second largest in population, China\u2019s market size is enormous, and that size advantage will only continue to grow, since Chinese labor productivity, as a less-productive economy, will also certainly grow faster than U.S. productivity for the next 30 or 40 years. Not only is China\u2019s market size enormous, but in many key industries, foreign companies are effectively precluded from gaining any significant market access. For example, Chinese telecom services firms have to buy a small amount of equipment from Ericsson and Nokia in order to give the impression of an open market, but the reality is that their market share is essentially allocated by the government, with most of the market reserved for Chinese firms. China imposes this managed market access through a variety of means, including tax incentives, directions to SOEs, and informal pressures on other firms to buy domestic. On top of that, China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, coupled with massive export-financing programs to much of the rest of the developing world, means that China is aggressively fighting for and gaining market share outside China, especially outside Western nations. Also, once Chinese firms enter new markets, consumers get comfortable with them and they are in the pipeline, including having distribution networks. These become self-reinforcing. China also uses government policies to expand market demand for innovative products and services, knowing that robust domestic demand for these products gives their companies a leg up. One of the keys in Michael Porter\u2019s national competitiveness \u201cdiamond\u201d framework is demanding customers who want innovative products. [285] China has those companies. For example, the government provides massive subsidies for robotic adoption, which in turn helps its robotics producers gain scale. China has at least 25 nuclear reactors under construction, far more than any other country. It is driving \u201csmart industry\u201d transformation, in part to provide a market to companies providing these services. It enables the rapid deployment of drone deliveries. Its policies to pressure and incent Chinese drivers to buy EVs is why China leads the world in EV development and production. It makes it easy for AV makers to field cars. It has some of the most advanced infrastructure projects in the world that incorporate advanced technologies. This societal risk-taking and seeding of new markets through government policy gives China an advantage over many other nations where stasis and market-dominated development have become the norm. Companies seeking to develop and sell innovative products can be more assured of sales when the government helps drive technology transformation and adoption. It is striking that China now far exceeds the United States in terms of policies to expand adoption of advanced technologies. If anything, U.S. policy is now decidedly neutral or even negative toward societal technology transformation. [286] It is striking that China now far exceeds the United States in terms of policies to expand adoption of advanced technologies. If anything, U.S. policy is now decidedly neutral or even negative toward societal technology transformation. 4. Speed The Chinese innovation system is centered not so much in laboratories but in production systems. As such, there is a requirement for speed. Constant feedback and learning from the market are incorporated as quickly into the product design and production system as possible. Like scale, this enables competitors to constantly bring market improvements, with the core imperative of gaining market share and getting scale before their competitors can, hoping for a virtuous cycle of growth. This is especially true for private Chinese companies, particularly newer ones. In contrast, many of the foreign companies they are competing against are large, bureaucratic multinationals whose complex processes get in the way of speed. Local, provincial, and national governments more often than not want to get out of the way of companies moving fast, unlike the United States, where slowing things down is now standard fare. 5. Local Suppliers Henry Ford\u2019s River Rouge factory in Detroit was a model of vertical integration. In the last half century, production systems have become more spatially distributed with multiple tiers of suppliers. However, speed and innovation often require close linkages with suppliers. When most suppliers are in close geographic proximity of the large original equipment manufacturers(OEMs), the process of sending requirements to suppliers (and learning from suppliers) and getting back new products is much faster. Most companies in the West have chosen globally distributed supply chains, in large part to cut costs by locating some or most of their production in lower-cost places. But that has come at the cost of speed and innovation. As professors Joshua Murry and Michael Swartz argued in Wrecked: How the American Automobile Industry Destroyed Its Capacity to Compete, one reason for the relative decline of the U.S. auto industry is the Big Three producers geographically separated production and R&D systems by moving so much of the former to low-cost regions. [287] In contrast, since China is still largely a low-cost production system, most Chinese suppliers are still in China, often in the same region as the OEM. In addition, because China specializes so much in manufacturing, and particularly in certain kinds of industries, it is able to enjoy rich and deep local production agglomerations. 6. Subsidies and Other Protections Firms often have to compete in \u201cunfair\u201d markets, if only because many factors affect the value of currency. Hence, firms can find themselves with an uncompetitive cost structure in global markets even though they are doing everything right. But leaving this aside, firm competition plays out through several key factors, with price and quality being the most important. If one firm is provided subsidies (including a devalued currency), it has\u2014all else equal\u2014a competitive advantage over its foreign competitors that receive limited subsidies. The firm can use that advantage to cut prices and gain market share. It can boost its scale and learning economies. Or it can invest those subsidies in R&D and other areas to boost quality and innovation, again taking market share from its competitors. China\u2019s subsidies are on steroids because of the intense competition for industry between its cities and provinces, which shell out massive funds to support local champions. And it ignores the supposed WTO disciplines on subsidies. While a number of nations have relied on many forms of subsidies (low corporate taxes, tax incentives, grants, subsidized costs of inputs such as energy, and a suppressed value of their currency), by and large, the scale of the subsidies is usually limited, often by domestic political pressures from voters demanding lower taxes or higher spending to directly benefit them. At the same time, many Western nations implement various subsidy-limitation measures because they want competition to be on a level playing field. But China is exempt from all of those limitations. China\u2019s subsidies are on steroids, in part because of the intense competition for industry between its cities and provinces, which shell out massive funds to support local champions. And China flouts the flaccid World Trade Organization (WTO) disciplines on subsidies. The magnitude and extent of Chinese subsidies has been widely documented. Though dated, Haley and Haley\u2019s book Chinese Industrial Subsidies documents just how sizeable these were and the role they played in enabling China to gain global market share in the 2000s. More recently, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found, \u201cEven using a conservative methodology, China\u2019s industrial policy spending is enormous, totaling at least 1.73 percent of GDP in 2019. This is equivalent to more than $248 billion at nominal exchange rates and $407 billion at purchasing power parity exchange rates.\u201d [288] A new study from a German institute estimates, \u201cOverall, industrial subsidies in China are several times higher than those in large EU and OECD countries. The size of the estimated difference ranges from a ratio of at least three to four in conservative estimates to a ratio of as high as nine in more encompassing studies.\u201d [289] In 2022, 99 percent of listed firms in China received direct government subsidies. For example, the German study finds that Chinese EV maker BYD has received over $3.7 billion in subsidies. Overall, in 2019, Chinese industrial subsidies were 4.5 times greater than the United States as a share of GDP, and that is accounting for the U.S. subsidies related to national defense. [290] Hand in hand with subsidies are market access restrictions. The first directly helps a domestic company gain market share; the second helps indirectly by reducing the market share of a foreign competitor and increasing that domestic firm\u2019s share. For example, when the Chinese government tells its state-owned telecom providers to stop using American computer chips in their systems, this weakens companies such as Intel and AMD, while strengthening Chinese companies such as SMIC. While other Asian Tigers used subsidies and sometimes closed markets to develop industrially, they were limited in what they could do. At the end of the day, the Japanese and South Korean markets were just not that big to really make a dent in Western company global sales if they were cut off from market access. Moreover, as allies were dependent on the United States, they faced political limitations to what they could. China is different. Losing access to the Chinese market while allowing Chinse firms to have access to all of it structurally weakens non-Chinese firms while structurally strengthening Chinese firms. And of course, the United States has no real leverage over the Chinese government. Losing access to the Chinese market while allowing Chinse firms to have all of it structurally weakens non-Chinese firms while structurally strengthening Chinese firms. The West\u2019s model is different. The predominant conception of economic and business competition is akin to an ecosystem that should be kept in balance (or more accurately, should not be put out of balance by government interventions). In this model, markets achieve allocation efficiency (the preeminent goal in neo-classical economics) where there is a \u201cgoldilocks\u201d allocation of production, not too much of x, and not too little of x. This same self-adjusting model works across borders too, through the magic of Ricardian comparative advantage. In this model, the country that has the inherent comparative advantage in making a good (textiles in England) trades with other countries for something they have an advantage in (wine in Portugal). All is in balance. In this naturalistic conception, everything moves toward harmony, as long as government has open markets (limited protectionism) and free markets (limited subsidies and regulations). Heaven on earth\u2014allocation efficiency! The maximum long-run production curve. That almost utopian model is fundamentally counter to China\u2019s conception of economic competition. And as such, it is no longer fit as a valid model for operating an economy, unless the other nations could find a way to completely isolate the Chinese economy. In this case, China would boost its own champions and keep Western firms out, but it would not destroy the latter. The rest of the world could have free markets with no subsidies and all would be mostly well. But even with talk of decoupling, that \u201csolution\u201d will not happen because the fastest growing markets in the world\u2014those in the developing world\u2014will not choose this path. Many are already tightly linked to China, in large part because of the massive amounts of foreign investment and aid China receives in these countries, and because these nations are loathe to choose sides between China and the U.S.-led West. And even if Western nations could find the political will to completely decouple (they won\u2019t because some countries, especially in Europe, refuse, seeking their own short-term gains in China at the expense of the collective good of the West), the resulting share of the global economy would be modest in size and gradually shrinking, given the much-faster expected growth rates of the non-Western world over the next multiple decades. Finally, some will argue that the United States has joined the subsidy race and that all is on par. But while the CHIPS Act was long overdue, it\u2019s important to note that its grant funding of $49 billion is dwarfed by Chinese semiconductor subsidies of over $81 billion. [291] 7. Firm Size With Competition Firm size matters in international competition. This is even more crucial given the increasing share of knowledge-based industries, with high fixed costs and low marginal costs, including telecommunications equipment, aerospace, semiconductors, drugs, and software. More sales means continual lower marginal costs and increased revenues to reinvest. And the size of a firm also matters because, for some industries (e.g., jet airplanes, jet engines, high-speed rail, logic chips, etc.), the high fixed costs of production means the global market can only support a few players. Antitrust is much more aggressive in the West than in China. As long as massive firms are acting in the interest of the state, China not only tolerates them, but also encourages them to get even bigger. China understands this and has adopted a strategy of industrial consolidation. Often, in part because of competition between provincial governments but also because the central government does not know what firms will ultimately emerge as winners, Chinese governments support more firms than makes economic sense. However, at some point, the central government institutes policies to separate the wheat from the chaff and winnow down the number of competitors. In many cases, this can take the form of forced mergers, as we saw with the creation of the China Railway Construction Corporation, its national rail champion. In 2023, China began a massive consolidation of its steel industry that will result in just 10 producers holding 60 to 70 percent of industry capacity by 2025. [292] In other cases, such as Huawei, it supports companies to be full-solution providers to telecom providers around the world, allowing it to bring to bear turnkey solutions that are much harder for more narrowly focused Western telecom equipment firms to emulate. Again, this is very different from the West, where antitrust officials are on constant vigil to prevent firms from getting too large, worrying that they will harm allocation efficiency, resulting in what economists call \u201cdeadweight economic losses.\u201d That is why antitrust is much more aggressive in the West than in China. However, as long as these massive Chinese firms are acting in the interest of the state, China not only tolerates them, but also encourages them to get even bigger. Like so many Chinese policy areas, antitrust is used as a competitiveness tool: encouraging scale in domestic firms and attacking foreign firms, either by limiting global mergers of firms that, because they need to do business in China, must get Chinese government approval, or prosecuting foreign firms in China on bogus charges such as \u201cprice fixing\u201d as a way to reduce their revenue and provide low-cost inputs to Chinese firms. [293] China knows that international techno-economic competition is like Sumo wrestling: Bulking up makes a big difference. It is also important to note that Chinese policy is often to encourage hyper-competition for new industries, with vastly too many firms entering into markets. The central government lets these firms compete and eventually limits support so that many go out of business, leaving only the toughest and most efficient. In this case, hyper-market competition weeds out the weak. This is very different than certain regions such as Europe, where antitrust and other policy keep less-than-fully-competitive firms alive for long periods of time. In contrast, the U.S. system, not only in antitrust but also in economic policy more broadly, has historically been oriented around maximizing consumer welfare. As discussed ahead, the anticapitalists on the left and the \u201cworker capitalists\u201d on the right reject even that and want to maximize worker and small business welfare (who they see as no different than oppressed workers). In contrast, the Chinese system is oriented around one goal: boosting national techno-economic power. Consumers be damned. Workers? Who cares? Optimally, economic systems should be about boosting productivity, not consumer or worker welfare directly. But given that the Chinese system is about national economic power and supporting competitively strong internationally traded firms, unless the United States also makes this a priority, it will continue to lose. 8. Specialization China goes deep, and that makes innovation easier. For example, unlike the United States, where a research university may have just a few professors working on a particular area, China has established research institutes where a hundred researchers are working on the same topic. For example, China has close to 50 graduate programs that focus on either battery chemistry or the closely related subject of battery metallurgy. By contrast, only a handful of professors in the United States are working on batteries. [294] This is similar to other Asian Tiger nations that have large specialized industrial research labs, such as ITRI in Taiwan focused largely on electronics and South Korea\u2019s Electrotechnology Research Institute. [295] In China, we see this with its State Key Laboratories (SKL) program, which, according to one report, is a \u201cmethod of teaming researchers and developers as a strategy to tackle hard problems [and which] has long been hailed as a successful model, as was seen with Bell Labs in the United States.\u201d [296] The over 500 SKLs are usually located at universities, although in the last decade, the Chinese government has funded private companies to form SKLs, akin to Bell Labs. We also see this focus on specialization in Chinese government efforts to form advanced technology regional clusters. A Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) report on SKLs notes that \u201cto streamline the innovation process from basic to applied research, Beijing has co-located enterprises, universities, research institutions, and SKLs to form industry clusters.\u201d [297] One participant told ITIF that there are universities in China that only focus on battery research. For example, China\u2019s SKL for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces employs over 100 researchers at Xieman University. [298] In contrast, NSF funds 19 Engineering Research Centers (ERCs) and a total of 79 since the program\u2019s inception, and only about half of these are focused on technologies that could be used in globally traded industries. A typical one, such as the Center for Innovative and Strategic Transformation of Alkane Resources, has only about 30 researchers, and few of them work full-time at the center. Another example is China\u2019s system of Manufacturing Institutes, copied from the Manufacturing USA system. But one big difference is that in China, activities are colocated with institutes, companies, and R&D labs. For example, the Dongguan robot city is a government-supported robotics research institute anchored by over 400 Chinese nearby robotics companies. [299] These Chinese institutes are funded usually at least more than 10 times the amount of the U.S. centers. 9. Space By \u201cspace\u201d we mean the space given for innovators to take risks and test technologies, or what Adam Thierer calls \u201cpermissionless innovation.\u201d [300] For the most part, China\u2019s innovators not only face few barriers compared with what Western innovators face, but they are also often encouraged and supported by the government to take these risks. We see this, for example, with Chinese policy toward AVs they support. [301] Likewise, China is supporting futuristic smart cities, drone deliveries, smart agriculture, and more. [302] Given the importance of first-mover advantages and large markets, such an orientation is a key edge for Chinese firms. Because the Chinese government is so desirous of innovation leadership, it has largely refrained from imposing restrictions on technology firms, except in a few industries wherein it does not see their interests as aligned with state interests. China\u2019s innovators not only face few barriers compared with what Western innovators face, but they are also often encouraged and supported by the government to take these risks. It may sound strange to argue that innovators in a communist society experience more freedom to innovate than those in a democratic capitalist system, but that is in fact the case. Europe has long placed regulation ahead of innovation, even convincing itself that regulation and limiting technology and (U.S.) technology firms actually spurs innovation by boosting consumer trust. And in the last decade, the United States and Commonwealth nations have begun to embrace the same view, seeing a wide variety of innovations, including AI, big data, facial recognition, AVs, drones, and more as requiring strict regulation in order to ensure that they are \u201chuman centered.\u201d Moreover, another factor giving Chinese companies space and permission appears to be what Columbia professor Amar Bhid\u00e9 has also called \u201cventuresome consumption\u201d: the eagerness of a nation\u2019s consumers to be early adopters of and experiment with new products and technologies. The United States used to be strong in that, but it appears that Chinese consumers are more risk tolerant now and are seeking out the newest and most innovative products. [303] 10. Strategy Finally, what underpins the Chinese innovation model is strategy for achieving its goal of gaining advanced technology advantage over its adversaries. By \u201cstrategy,\u201d we do not necessarily mean a formal document or process laying out steps. Often, Chinese tech policy is more akin to \u201ccrossing the river by touching the stones,\u201d an incremental process, sometimes involving mistakes and reversals, but always in the service of crossing the river: innovation leadership. And unlike the United States, where multiple, often warring factions competing in the interagency process related to tech, trade, and industrial policy make all-of-government solutions all but impossible, those kinds of solutions are the norm in China. Coupled with that is China\u2019s a deep and wide expertise in government and academia in science and technology policy, a discipline that is largely ignored in America. In China, they study global science and technology policy, are deeply familiar with the literature, especially of that in the West, and use that expertise to effectively shape policy. In addition, Chinese science and technology policy for competitiveness is very intergovernmental, where not only does Beijing drive science and technology policy, but so too do the 23 provinces and the multiple large cities. [304] Finally, China is not a democracy, and that brings benefits and costs, although at this stage of its development, this may bring more benefits. The CCP\u2019s control means that it has more leeway to ignore vested interests and focus on its overall mission to lead innovation. Coupled with that is China\u2019s deep and wide expertise in government and academia in science and technology policy, a discipline that is largely ignored in America. There is one other important aspect of the Chinese innovation system, and that is it has largely been built from the bottom up. In other words, China was long a laggard and a copier and competed in sectors and parts of businesses that were more commodity-like and lower value added. The West, and especially the United States, was more than willing to shed many of these segments, content in the belief that it was shedding \u201cdogs\u201d and embracing stars. China used that and moved up the value chain, creating what Clay Christensen has termed \u201clow-end disruption.\u201d Li and Zhang refer to this as \u201clate development advantage,\u201d where these nations can copy and build on the leaders\u2019 technology, but only if they embrace a development state. [305] To be sure, moving up to original and high-end disruption is hard, but that strategy does have advantages in that it builds on itself, as we have seen the same strategy used successfully by the other Asian Tigers. This bottom-up, supply-side approach is why Chinese innovation and dependencies\u2014the processing of rare earths, every part of a battery, process know-how, etc.\u2014now occur at every level of the value chain. As discussed ahead, the United States shed too much, and the lack of deep competencies along the supply chain now serves as a hinderance to success. Implications of the Chinese Innovation Model While the Chinese innovation model is similar to what Japan and the Asian Tigers relied on to become innovation leaders, it is different in fundamental ways\u2014the most important being the size of the Chinese economy, the level of control by the government, and the level of commitment to dominate in innovation across most advanced industries. What does this \u201cAsian-Tiger on Steroids\u201d model mean for Western economies? If the latter were a completely closed economy with no trade with China, and had no need for their largest companies to sell much outside the West, there would be no negative impacts on Western industry from this Chinese innovation system. Their companies and workers could thrive in such a bifurcated economy. This is what both progressives and the \u201cNew Right\u201d seek as a solution to the China challenge. The progressives, including the Biden administration, seek a more closed U.S. economy immune from global competition. Former President Trump appears to want the same. But the reality is that the United States must do battle for foreign economic \u201cterritory\u201d and cannot cede these markets to Chinese firms. The U.S. market, as large as it is, is too small to support healthy rates of innovation and production in most advanced industries. That leaves the question of what the United States and other Western nations should do. To date, most are in denial, arguing that China is a paper tiger, and even that its economy is stagnating, if not declining. This is wishful thinking at best. The U.S. market, as large as it is, is too small to support healthy rates of innovation and production and many advanced industries. Others deny that we are even in competition with other countries. They subscribe to the Paul Krugman notion that competitiveness is a \u201cdangerous illusion.\u201d [306] Still others have an ideological commitment to the view that the Western model of innovation, especially America\u2019s, is so superior to China\u2019s state-directed capitalism that we should just stay the course and that China will eventually crash and burn, as they wrongly believe that Japan\u2019s economy did. Others argue that the challenge is principally militarily, with China seeking to invade and to take over Taiwan. In this case, China could gain control of key parts of the supply chain, particularly semiconductors. This was the principal rationale for the passage of the CHIPS Act. But the threat from China goes beyond its possible takeover of Taiwan. There are a host of advanced industries China is seeking to gain dominance in. Related to this is the concept of derisking, something EU officials have focused on to ensure that they are not like the Americans who supposedly focus on decoupling. Derisking is designed to identify some key products, such as rare earths, that China could control, and ensure that there is adequate production in either home of allied markets. Derisking is important, but the very concept implies that only a modest share of materials is at risk of Chinese control, rather than the entire advanced industrial base. To the extent elected officials, experts, and pundits worry about the ability of the United States to effectively compete with China, the dictate is to do what we have been doing, only more and better. In an article about what the new conservative movement should do to address the China challenge, David Goldman wrote that Congress should massively increase federal basic research funding \u201cto revive the system of public-private partnerships that allowed the federal government to subsidize basic research while leaving the risk of commercialization to private entrepreneurs.\u201d [307] The liberal Center for American Progress agrees, writing that we should be \u201ccapitalizing on our existing strengths, including our unique innovation ecosystem.\u201d [308] The Rand Corporation tells the Department of Defense (DOD) that \u201cf eatures inherent to the U.S innovation system\u2014robust IP protection, the prospect of high returns to innovation and strong government-university-industry linkages\u2014stimulate creativity, encourage innovation, and foster entrepreneurship.\u201d [309] The Atlantic Council proposes a number of steps to effectively compete with China, including boosting government R&D funding, improving STEM, and \u201c [c]raft[ing] a more diverse tech sector,\u201d and allowing more high-skill immigration. [310] Thomas Mahnken, president of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, summed up the conventional view best when he said recently: The U.S. system is superior to the Chinese system overall, so we\u2019re not going to enjoy success by trying to out-authoritarian the authoritarians. We\u2019re going to enjoy success by bolstering our system\u2014and I actually say in a number of cases\u2014becoming more true to the nature of our system. [311] This has become the new Washi ngton Consensus. If the old Washington consensus was about \u201cmarket capitalism: fiscal policy discipline, no subsidies, a neutral tax code, and trade liberalization,\u201d the new consensus is about \u201csupport capitalism\u201d\u2014more R&D, more skills, and deregulation\u2014but all the while staying true to the \u201cU.S. model.\u201d These kinds of solutions might have worked 30 years ago when the global scientific research circulation system was more limited and many countries did not have the capabilities to absorb that research. But today, it is a recipe for giving the Chinese a massive amount of knowledge. This is even more true given China\u2019s development of \u201ca vast artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platform dubbed \u2018Supermind\u2019 to track millions of scientists and researchers around the world.\u201d [312] If the old Washington consensus was about \u201cmarket capitalism: fiscal policy discipline, no subsidies, a neutral tax code, and trade liberalization,\u201d the new consensus is about \u201csupport capitalism\u201d\u2014more R&D, more skills, and deregulation\u2014but all the while staying true to the \u201cU.S. model.\u201d If the West generally, and the United States specifically, is to not lose the global innovation production race to China, it will need to more than simply double down on what has worked in the past. Tweaking or even making significant improvements to our system is no longer enough. To be fair, that is at least better than ignoring the challenge (either through massive spending on redistribution or budget cuts and tax cuts on individuals) or attacking U.S. technology leaders (e.g., aggressive antitrust actions against tech leaders and even more restrictive technology regulation). But incremental reform it is not enough. If the United States is to avoid becoming a second-rate technology economy dependent on China, it\u2019s time to \u201cbreak glass\u201d and craft a completely new national innovation system. America\u2019s Challenge: Ideological Divergence There are five competing visions for U.S. capitalism in the age of China competition, and each supports a fundamentally different approach to competing with the Chinese. As we argue ahead, only one\u2014\u201cnational power capitalism\u201d\u2014has any chance of succeeding against China. Market Global Capitalism The first vision is market capitalism, the traditional doctrine in the United States, at least since the 1980s and on the right and center right. In this view, proselytized by think tanks such as the Peterson Institute and the Cato Institute, free markets and unfettered globalization are the best way to drive growth, and any alterations impose costs. Moreover, price-mediated markets are ideally global in nature. For free-market capitalists, the ideal economy is a giant, globally integrated market, wherein capital, goods and services, and people should be able to move anywhere, any time, with no barriers or limitations. In this world, there are \u201cno winners that take all, we are all winners.\u201d [313] In other words, there is simply no way that Chinese policies can hurt us, because it\u2019s free trade and free trade is welfare maximizing for all parties. This is why the worst thing we can do is respond with \u201cprotectionism.\u201d And because they privilege consumer welfare, if the Chinese want to sell Americans products below their production cost, that\u2019s great for us. Cheap goods! As a result, they see a government that doesn\u2019t imbibe the drink of market capitalism as a barrier to this nirvana. If the United States is to avoid becoming a second-rate technology economy, dependent on China, it\u2019s time to \u201cbreak glass\u201d and craft a completely new national innovation system organized around \u201cnational power capitalism.\u201d A key component of the market capitalism doctrine is that market failures are few, and government failures rampant. In only a very limited number of cases, government intervention is required, but it\u2019s a bit like drinking: only in moderation. As such, for them, there are two key mortal sins: 1) anything that limits unfettered globalization (what they disparagingly call \u201cprotectionism\u201d), and 2) industrial policy, which, for them, is pretty much any and all government actions to alter market-based outcomes for particular industries. It\u2019s important to realize that the free-market capitalist believers base their argument on one key factor: It doesn\u2019t matter what a nation\u2019s industrial structure is. Car rental, car production\u2014what\u2019s the difference? In fact, whatever industries a nation has are optimal, unless a government is stupid or craven enough to try to alter industrial composition through industrial policy. After all, the market knows best, and Chinese investment and trade are part of the market. The reality is that even if market capitalism produced optimal results in a world without China, it fails in a world with China. The reason is simple: Because of Chinese state capitalism, Chinese companies overinvest in certain industries China desires leadership in. By definition, that lowers capital returns, not only in China but also in other countries competing in the same industries. Thus, firms in market capitalist nations rationally cut investment in these sectors because they cannot earn market-based returns. As such, Chinese policy reduces U.S. capital investment in the sectors China wants to dominate, not only distorting allocation efficiency, but also weakening U.S. key sectors. The doctrine of market capitalism never conceived of such a system, and as such is incapable of coping with this reality. As hard as it may be for many people to believe that the market capitalists actually believe the doctrine, they indeed do. When one head of a leading international trade think tank was asked how much manufacturing the U.S. could lose and still be OK, he said \u201call of it.\u201d [314] Likewise, Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute, recently stated (wrongly) that trying to revive manufacturing is sexist and racist, because manufacturing largely employs white males. [315] If the market capitalists were to acknowledge that America\u2019s prosperity and power depended on technologically advanced traded sectors, the entire edifice of their ideological framework would come tumbling down. They would have to acknowledge that their belief in global free markets could be problematic. This is why they regularly and so vigorously try to claim that all is well with U.S. manufacturing, even though the evidence says otherwise. [316] And for most of them, data, evidence, and logic will not change their core religious views. The only thing to change this is their retirement and, hopefully, replacement by pragmatists. If you don\u2019t have to worry about industrial structure, you\u2019re pretty much free to just do nothing, and your main task is to be on the constant vigil of identifying inappropriate market interventions such as trade restrictions, the CHIPS Act, and other nefarious things that distort free markets. This is why they deny that China is a problem. Who cares whether China gets all the manufacturing and other high-tech sectors such as software, because financial services and tourism is just as good, and likely even better since these are likely where America\u2019s natural comparative advantage is. At heart, they are Panglossians: Whatever world America is in is the optimal one, unless it is a world where the voting know-nothings have pressed for market-distorting policies, especially protectionism. If the market capitalists were to acknowledge that America\u2019s prosperity and power depended on technologically advanced traded sectors, the entire edifice of their ideological framework would come tumbling down. Over the last decade, some market capitalists have made two concessions to reality. First, many now feel compelled to talk about distribution and fairness. After all, even they are not blind to the costs of Chinese industrial predation. But their solutions are not to address U.S. competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis China, but to help the \u201closers,\u201d many of whom should just get a degree in finance or computer science. And their solutions are market supporting (such as an earned income tax credit) rather than market \u201cdistorting,\u201d such as supporting manufacturing or a higher minimum wage. Second, some now give lip service to the need to restructure our economy around the \u201cgreen transition,\u201d but again, only with market-based solutions such as a carbon tax, or second-best solutions, such as the tax credits for green production in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Many oppose other kinds of industrial policy, including the CHIPS Act, because they not only remain agnostic about the nation\u2019s industrial mix, but they also see any help for industry as simply boosting profits at the expense of the proletariat. One leading former Obama administration official noted at an off-the-record dinner that he opposed the CHIPS Act because it would by definition raise profits of semiconductor firms, ignoring the reality that the act was designed to reduce the delta between costs of production in the United States and other nations, especially Asian ones. For him and others, the key is to identify \u201climiting factors\u201d that can keep industrial policy from spreading, like some kind of out-of-control virus. Green-transition policies are acceptable. Income redistribution is acceptable. But pretty much nothing else is. But there is really no limiting factor to defense spending, other than to maintain superiority over our adversaries. That should be the sole limiting factor for U.S. industrial policy. Overall, free market globalists scoff at the notion that China could win and the United States lose in advanced industry competition. They see it as not only highly unlikely but also completely irrelevant because there is no winning and losing in international trade. Finally, the global free market camp sees the optimal system as one of unfettered trade barriers, even if the trade of one country is based on massive subsidies and stolen IP. The greatest sin is to erect any barriers to free trade. As WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said: We are certainly concerned. We don\u2019t want to see a further escalation of these kinds of measures between the two big powers in the world. We would not want the world to fragment into two trading blocs, one with the U.S. and one with China, because that will be a big loss to the world. When we do these studies of such a break, it shows everyone would lose. The U.S. would lose. China would lose. And developing countries would lose more if we broke into two geopolitical blocs along those lines. So, we are very concerned. [317] In other words, the better system would be for the United States to erect no barriers to trade with China while allowing China to manipulate its currency, provide massive subsidies, tie market access to tech transfer, and limit market access for foreign firms. Market globalists scoff at the notion that China could win and the United States lose in advanced industry concentration. They see it as not only highly unlikely but also completely irrelevant because there is no winning and losing in international trade. Market capitalism still guides much of the elite narrative on what the United States should do. A recent article in Foreign Affairs states: By offering large incentives to companies that invest in critical sectors in the United States, Washington could replicate some of the same problems that are plaguing China\u2019s economy: a reliance on debt-fueled investment, unproductive resource allocation, and, potentially, a speculative bubble in tech-company stocks that could destabilize the market if it suddenly burst. If the goal is to outcompete Beijing, Washington should concentrate on what the American system is already better at: innovation, market disruption, and the intensive use of private capital, with investors choosing the most promising areas to support and taking the risks along with the rewards. By fixating on strategies to limit China\u2019s economic advantages, the United States risks neglecting its own strengths. [318] In a game that has been fundamentally transformed, the stubborn adherence to free market globalization is a weakness, akin to the French belief in the Maginot Line before the emergence of mobile warfare in WWII. Finally, one argument defenders of market capitalism make is that it helps keep individuals free from government, with many on the right worrying that any expansion of government leads to a kind of totalitarianism Hayek warned against. [319] But in 1944, when Hayek wrote The Road to Serfdom , the Soviets were allies, so America could afford to imagine that we could survive with small government. But soon after the Soviet Union gave the green light to North Korea to invade South Korea in 1950, it became clear that the much more significant threat to American\u2019s freedom was not Washington, but Moscow. So both parties built the national security state, and under President Reagan\u2019s leadership, America defeated the Soviets. Today, we need a national power capitalist state to keep American freedoms intact from Beijing. Support Capitalism As the limitations of market capitalism have become clearer, particularly as an adequate response to Chinese state capitalism, a new, slightly more interventionist form of market capitalism has gained adherents, what can be termed \u201csupport capitalism.\u201d In this framing, global free trade is still the model, but now the government plays a stronger role in supporting R&D, boosting education and skills, supporting entrepreneurship, and of course, helping workers who have been hurt by globalization to adjust. A seminal article by Kurt Campbell and Jake Sullivan, warning of the decline of the United States vis-\u00e0-vis China, discusses the notion of \u201csupport capitalism\u201d: Washington must dramatically increase funds for basic science research and invest in clean energy, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and computing power. At the same time, the federal government should scale up its investments in education at all levels and in infrastructure, and it should adopt immigration policies that continue to enhance the United States\u2019 demographic and skills advantage. [320] While support capitalism is undoubtedly superior to market capitalism, it remains structurally deficient to enable America to compete with China. It is based on the notion of \u201cingredientism,\u201d the belief that a nation can succeed principally by having robust quantities of the right ingredients. These can include more trade agreements, good universities, the rule of law, educated workers, good broadband, more basic science, etc. If government can just provide adequate ingredients and framework conditions, firms will prosper and effectively compete with China. While support capitalism is undoubtedly superior to market capitalism, it remains structurally deficient to enable America to compete with China. It is based on the notion of \u201cingredientism,\u201d the belief that a nation can succeed principally by having robust quantities of the right ingredients. But when competing with China, it\u2019s not just the quantity of the ingredients, it is also having the right ingredients to make the right dishes. If China is seeking to dominate particular key industries, a policy that does not respond with recipes that focus on these industries will lose. Moreover, ingredients are not enough to build regional technology hubs, start-ups, and high-productivity firms. Policy needs to be focused on getting firms to take the kinds of steps that will lead to long-term success against Chinese firms. Anticorporate Capitalism As the flaws of market capitalism have become more widely accepted, progressives have used them to advance a counter-doctrine of anticorporate capitalism. For them, corporate capitalism is the source of climate disaster, racial and gender oppression, inequality, the breakdown of democracy, worker victimization, and every other ill that can be imagined. They want small and mid-sized enterprises to dominate, or in industries where scale economies or technological complexity makes that impossible, heavy regulation or government ownership. They oppose investing in advanced industries because the money goes to corporations (something to be avoided at all costs), and instead call for massive government spending (or tax breaks) for childcare, housing, education, mass transit, distributed energy, universal basic income, and retirement security, all of which they portray as investment and even industrial policy. For them, the China challenge is irrelevant, and to the extent people call it out, they are racists. Anticorporate capitalism paves the road not only to the United States losing to China, but to U.S. de-technologicalization. If market capitalists want the government to do nothing, anticorporate capitalists want it to do everything, including replacing large business. It is ironic and troubling that at the very moment America is in desperate need of an all-of-society, all-of-government approach to not losing to China in advanced industries, the Left has coalesced around an anti-big business doctrine and agenda. Anticorporatists deny America is in competition with other nations, not only because of their desire for global wealth redistribution but also because they know global competition makes it harder to put in place a raft of needed policies they disdain, such as lower business taxes and limited regulations. Like free market capitalists, they deny the importance of any particular industry over another, with the exception of green industries and social care industries, both of which are elevated to a privileged status: the \u201cgreen, care economy.\u201d For them, the most important aspect of the CHIPS Act was not building fabs, but rather requiring day care centers at fabs and compliance with Davis-Bacon construction labor requirements. This gets to why both the libertarian Right and the anticapitalist Left deny the China challenge so vociferously. They know that if policymakers take China seriously, it destroys both the antimonopoly movement and the free-market movement. Libertarianism becomes thrown on the scrap heap of history because the state is needed to keep American industry strong. And for the anticorporatists, it means supporting large corporations. Lina Khan threw her weight into this revisionist effort with a recent speech at the Carnegie Endowment and an article in Foreign Policy , in which she declared, \u201cTo stay ahead globally, we don\u2019t need to protect our monopolies from innovation\u2014we need to protect innovation from our monopolies . \u201d [321] In other words, it\u2019s OK to break up big companies, it will even help us compete with China. However, unlike the free market capitalists, the anticorporatists reject globalization. For them, globalization brings competition, something they abhor, in part because it limits the extent to which government can impose taxes and restrictions on business. Anticorporatism is economic isolationism and autarky, disengaging from competition with other nations (thereby allowing the government to impose any and all anticorporate policies with no impact on competitiveness) and not only ending trade expansion but reversing it. This is why we hear almost nothing from U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai. Her job is not trade expansion; it is trade contraction. The anticorporatists deny America is in competition with other nations, not only because of their desire for global wealth redistribution, even at costs to the U.S. economy, but because they know global competition makes it harder to put in place a raft of needed policies they disdain, such as lower business taxes and limited regulations. If the United States is relatively autarkic, such as before the 1970s, tax and regulate to your heart\u2019s content\u2014we won\u2019t lose any jobs to nations that don\u2019t follow this path. Moreover, most anticorporatists see not only the U.S. proletariat as a victim of U.S. capitalist greed but also the great masses in developing nations, including China. They advocate for policies to support the global proletariat over U.S. companies, denying both the very idea of the U.S. national interest and the deep link between U.S. company interests and U.S. national and worker interests. Finally, their goal is not competitiveness, as that is something they fear might help American capitalists instead of the global proletariat, especially people of color. As bizarre as it sounds, most anticapitalists side more with the Chinese (and third-world) proletariat than with U.S. companies. Economist Joe Stiglitz, who pushes for weak IP protection in the United States so that developing countries can pay less for U.S. IP, is a case in point. [322] This is why they want to do everything possible to avoid techno-economic competition with China, advocating instead for cooperation. [323] Worker and Climate Capitalism There is another contender to replace market capitalism as the dominant doctrine and that is what could be called \u201cworker and climate capitalism.\u201d Indeed, there is one form of industrial and trade policy that is now at least somewhat acceptable across the political spectrum: using government policy, including trade and industrial policy, to support \u201cnoble\u201d goals, which include using manufacturing policy as social policy to create more blue-collar jobs and industrial policy as green policy. Many on the \u201cnew right\u201d attack market fundamentalism for ignoring blue-collar workers and advocate for a robust focus on manufacturing. [324] New-right pundit Sohrab Ahmari writes that dismantling the neoliberal order requires \u201ca labor market in which most sectors are unionized\u201d and a higher minimum wage for all workers, giving labor the \u201csecurity needed to mount countervailing power in the absence of labor organization.\u201d [325] Bob Lighthizer\u2019s book No Trade is Free Trade is emblematic of this, as he wants to reorient trade policy to focus first and foremost on helping American workers, particularly blue-collar workers. In this doctrine, high tariffs on all manufactured goods are a positive because it will help manufacturing workers. Leaving aside that high tariffs on imported goods might actually hurt many U.S. manufacturers, the problem with worker capitalism is that it is not strategic vis-\u00e0-vis Chinese industrial competition. Making either jets and jars employs blue-collar workers, but only the former is strategic relative to China. The Biden administration\u2019s worker-oriented trade policy is of the same making. USTR Tai recently stated: The Biden-Harris administration\u2019s approach to trade has been to democratize economic opportunity. We are breaking out of the technocrats\u2019 bubble to meet working people where they are, redesigning the incentive structure so that communities are not pitted against each other. For example, for a long time, workers in Ohio or Pennsylvania or Arizona have been set against workers in Mexico, where rights have been unfairly suppressed. This is what happens when we blindly believe that liberalizing trade rules leads to a gradual improvement in labor standards as countries grow wealthier through trade flows. We are flipping this narrative on its head, using a trade agreement. [326] The problem with worker capitalism is that it is fundamentally indifferent to industrial competition. Making jets is the same as making jars. This doctrine privileges workers, rather than the nation. For example, it often leads to opposition to automation on the grounds that it hurts workers. It also leads to an \u201call is good\u201d approach to trade policy, where low-skill jobs are as good as high-skill ones. As such, it is largely a social policy doctrine\u2014helping particular kinds of workers and the environment\u2014that has the political benefit of appealing to voters in many presidential swing states. Some on the left and center argue for the same goal, but will often add in \u201cgreen jobs\u201d and the green transition as the lodestar of a new kind of \u201cclimate capitalism,\u201d wherein all policies are oriented around decarbonizing the global energy system. [327] Their agenda is not just about supporting clean energy production; for some on the left, it is much more ambitious and calls for \u201creforming capitalism\u201d itself, often involving \u201cdegrowth.\u201d Others, such as former Biden economic official Brian Deese, argue that the United States can regain competitiveness by leading the green economy. [328] However, the green economy simply cannot be the focus of an industrial policy designed to prevent China from winning, because energy sectors are too small. [329] More problematic, the green industrial agenda diverts needed attention from the China competition agenda. Terms Used to Describe Chinese Trade and Economic Practices Trade imbalances: Pudits use the term \u201ctrade imbalances\u201d as if it\u2019s just something that happens, as it\u2019s a bit out of balance. In fact, systematic and large Chinese trade surpluses in advanced goos are not happenstance; they reflect a strategy in the service of techno-economic aggression. China shock: Pundits refer to the massive offshoring and influx of products from China in the 2000s as a \u201cshock,\u201d similar to the oil shock of the late 1970s. Likewise many suggest that the West may face a second China shock in a range of new industries, including EVs. Again, this implies that these are random, one-time forces of nature. It would be like saying that the invasion of a country is a shock. No, it is an invastion. China as a trading partner: Canada and the United States are trading partners, as are Finland and the United Kingdom. \u201cTrading partner\u201d implies a country that is playing by the same rules and the result being mutually beneficial. That does not describe China\u2019s power trade to gain dominance in advanced industries. Chinese excess capacity: This refers to industries such as steel, solar panels, and now EVs, and implies a temporary mistake. Oops, we overshot the market and are now producing too much. No, Chinese excess production is a form of predatory dumping to gain global market share. Critical supply chain vulnerabilities: COVID was traumatic and, like other kinds of trauma, led people to the wrong conclusions. One is that the core challenge from China is supply chain vulnerabilities. At one level, this is correct, but some vulnerbilities don\u2019t really matter (e.g., industsries that are easily reproducable and have little national security implications), while some do (e.g., certain computer chips). Derisking: This is a term the EU popularized as a way to show that it does not support the more hard-edged U.S. approach to China. It is based on the idea that the main techno-economic challenge from China is in a few narrow areas, such as critical materials, and that the West should take some narrow strategic steps to lessen dependency. The issue is not so much derisking, as destruction; in other words, Chinese actions that lead to reduced market share for advanced Western firms. National Power Capitalism The fifth model\u2014one that is barely developed in the United States\u2014can be called \u201cnational power capitalism.\u201d It is time to copy key elements of the China model and transform the American system to \u201cnational power capitalism,\u201d or as Michael Lind and I have written elsewhere, a system of national developmentalism. [330] National power capitalism is a subset of national developmentalism\u2014the idea that the state plays a strong and conscious role to drive economic development. The former is more focused on policies that retain and gain techno-economic power over China. National power capitalism is premised on the reality of states competing with each other, not in some kind of Ricardian win-win, but in a more existential competition for power. Market-based economics and even support capitalism deny this reality and still believe in the win-win, Ricardian utopian vision. These doctrines are not adequate for a situation that is akin to a win-lose techno-economic war. Just as winning a kinetic war requires national defense policy, winning a techno-economic war requires a national advanced technology policy, grounded in national power capitalism. If economists were in charge of defense policy, they would say, \u201cDon\u2019t fund aircraft carriers or advanced jets because the cost-benefit is negative and there is no market failure.\u201d But we fund national defense because not doing so means giving up U.S. sovereignty. The same should be true for funding national advanced technology capabilities. This is not about market failures or narrow cost-benefit analysis; it\u2019s about not losing national power. It is goal oriented, just as defense policy is goal oriented. U.S. weapons policy is not process oriented. It\u2019s not as if officials say, \u201dLet\u2019s make sure procurement is streamlined and see what weapons get developed.\u201d Rather, the various defense forces identify their needs, and the system works to achieve those goals. That\u2019s what national power capitalism needs to do: We need a robust biotech industry, chip industry, aerospace industry, AI industry, etc., and then to design and implement policies to achieve that. Immediately we can hear the cries of \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be like China.\u201d Some pro-market advocates invoke the incantation to object to what we are already doing, such as passing the CHIPS and Science Act. But for most who say this, it has become some general phrase that is required as part of the discourse about U.S. advanced industry policy, although seldom are any specific reasons given. It\u2019s as if we all know that we shouldn\u2019t be like China, yet we should embrace the Chinese model, but with American characteristics. As the Chinese say, they have capitalism with Chinese characteristics. We need a similar kind of system but with American characteristics. One can hear the accusations now. You want the United States to limit democratic freedom? To not have the rule of law? To have heavy-handed government? Clearly there are many components of China the West should not copy: first and foremost, its Marxist-Leninist government with its authoritarianism, its rejection of human rights, high levels of corruption, lack of the rule of law, immiseration of the working class, government manipulation of technical standards, weak IP protection, and support of firms with massive subsidies that have no chance of survival without Chinese cash. Just as winning a kinetic war requires national defense policy, winning a techno-economic war requires a national advanced technology policy, grounded in national power capitalism. [331] However, we can walk and chew gum at the same time and emulate the many parts of the Chinese innovation system that would benefit us: China\u2019s high levels of investment, rather than spending. Its overarching focus on winning in selected advanced industries. Its building up strong levels of domestic agglomeration. Its becoming much faster and limiting the regulatory morass that in the United States has become reflexively \u201cno.\u201d The widespread support for innovation and progress. The Chinese government\u2019s relatively deep understanding and embrace of science and technology policy for competitiveness. As such, it\u2019s time for an open and honest debate about whether doubling down on the U.S. system is enough to address the unprecedented China techno-economic challenge or the U.S. government needs to adopt a new form of \u201cnational power capitalism\u201d: a system that relies on private companies, many of them very large, to fight our global techno-economic war, and also provides them with significantly more support (tax and direct spending) focused on significantly expanding techno-economic R&D and production in the United States in critical industries. A system that is more activist than \u201csupport capitalism,\u201d but less directive than China\u2019s state capitalism. It\u2019s time for an open and honest debate about whether doubling down on the U.S. system is enough to address the unprecedented China techno-economic challenge or the U.S. government needs to adopt a new form of \u201cnational power capitalism.\u201d A U.S. \u201c10 S\u2019s\u201d System What would a U.S. national innovation system that were modeled after China\u2019s \u201c10 S\u2019s\u201d look like? 1. Science and Engineering Talent The U.S. science system, like so many other U.S. systems, is no longer purpose fit for a world in which China is the pacing competitor. In the current model, researchers pick the areas of research. In a new model, the federal government and industry would prioritize key areas where China is a threat. In the current model, the federal government provides the lion\u2019s share of funding. In a new world, industry funding, incentivized by the federal government, would play a key role, including in the production of industry-oriented Ph.D.s. In the current model, publications are the key goal. In a new model, transferring knowledge to the domestic private sector would be the key goal. In the current model, science is seen as global, so cooperation with Chinese scientists and university students is an unalloyed good. In a new model, science cooperation with China would be seen as fraught with risks and largely stopped, and more focus placed on applied research. To emulate China, the United States needs more and stronger scientific and engineering talent, but that talent should be 1) oriented to industry more than academia and 2) aligned with the key technologies and industries the United States must be competitive in. In contrast, the U.S. system is now focused on generating university researchers in whatever fields the researchers are interested in. Instead, the college and graduate school system should be providing incentives for students to major in science (particularly fields related to competitiveness such as materials science, biology, engineering, and computer science). It is time to stop doubling down on science and hoping NSF will effectively support commercialization and innovation (it is not likely to) and instead establish a National Advanced Industry and Technology Agency that supports technology development in the United States instead of science for the world. This means the federal government, especially NSF and the Department of Energy, cease science cooperation with China. Just one of many examples: NSF is working with the National Natural Science Foundation of China and Beihang University, which is on the entities list, to fund quantum computing research. [332] In addition, the federal government should not provide funding to any university that allows Chinese STEM post-doctorates, because they are unlikely to stay in the United States. Finally, U.S. research support has become risk averse. In contrast, the Chinese government appears more willing to fund things that have a higher chance of failure. Our research system needs to take bigger risks and more \u201cswings for the fences.\u201d 2. Head Start With the exception of a few certain technologies, such as AI and biotech, it has been decades since the United States had a head start, not just in invention and early-stage innovation but also in production. The United States needs to regain that in a number of industries, such as weapons systems, automation technology, autonomous systems, synthetic biology and other advanced biotechnologies, and quantum computing. This will mean selecting key technologies and industries America can obtain a head start in, massively funding R&D, and then providing incentives to establish U.S. production facilities. 3. Market Size For many industries, adequate scale is not possible without global markets. This means the recent policy of retreating from global expansion must be reversed. This does not mean reverting to the prior era of globalization, which sought the creation of the one true global market and engaged in one-sided trade deals. The China challenge makes that an ill-advised, and impossible, strategy. But the opposite of trying to win as a largely national economy is just as ill advised. Instead, we need to create a new democratic, market-based trading bloc, ideally governed by a new organization separate from the WTO , which is now compromised in pushing back effectively against Chinese unfair economic practices. It\u2019s time to create an alternative to the WTO that only accepts as members countries committed to fair trade and the rule of law. Policymakers also need to ensure that the U.S. market is large enough and U.S. companies can adequately achieve scale globally. This requires three key things. First, a policy toward the dollar that lets it decline to a level where the trade deficit disappears. Regardless of macroeconomists claiming that the trade deficit is a result of a lack of savings, the reality is that the U.S. dollar\u2019s status as the reserve currency, and China\u2019s commitment to keeping the RMB low, is the principal cause of the U.S. trade deficit. It\u2019s time for the Treasury to take determined steps to devalue the dollar. Second, we need to limit Chinese access to our and other allied markets when its firms are benefiting from unfair policies and practices. This should be simple. It is not protectionism. Protectionism would be limiting Chinese firm access even if the firm were completely market-based. As such, the United States and its core allies, especially Europe, should identify Chinese firms that systematically benefit from more than de minimis unfair trade practices and block their market access . Third, U.S. policy needs to make fighting for market access in unaligned nations a key priority. This means steps such as Export-Import Bank expansion and aligning of U.S. aid policy with U.S. international economic imperatives. China sees market entry and expansion in the \u201cunaligned\u201d nations as critical to its plans to dominate industries. Through its massively funded export finance and development banks, China has been bribing the way for its industries to capture contracts and influence around the world. For them, it is a battlefield. For American policymakers, it is something that is nice to have, but not critical. U.S., and allied, policies need to make contesting unaligned markets a top priority. Fourth, policymakers should not succumb to the many forces that want to decouple from China, especially those voices saying that U.S. companies should not sell or invest in China. Selling to China is a way to make our market larger and theirs smaller. Investing can do the same. 4. Speed When Calvin Coolidge said that the business of America is business, America had speed. Innovators and builders could get things done, in rapid time. It took just 410 days to build the Empire State Building, the tallest building in the world then. Today, it takes decades to build big things, if they can ever get built at all. Congress and the next administration need to tear down many of the massive speed bumps, if not outright roadblocks, that keep enterprises from acting with speed. Maybe America could afford those in the pre-China competition days. It cannot today. This should start with Congress repealing most or all of the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), with it only applying to projects on federally owned lands. States and local governments can manage their own local environments. This means regaining the mindset the federal government had when Operation Warp Speed was implemented in record time (although even then, there were unnecessary delays). [333] Mass producing a vaccine for COVID-19 could have gotten America motivated to break through the nonsense. Not losing to China should be equally as compelling a motivation. This means not banning technologies. It means massive testbeds for new technologies, such as AVs (we have only one track in Michigan for testing). It means ending the paranoid narratives around AI and instead focusing national efforts and energy on speeding up AI development and deployment. It means that when Congress creates programs such as the Broadband Economic and Development (BEAD) program and the CHIPS Act that the administration agencies don\u2019t take years to finally get the programs rolled out. Any program Congress creates should be fully funded in no more than 12 months. As one working group participant said, \u201cIt\u2019s like America\u2019s hand and feet are bound, while China is sprinting away.\u201d Time to unleash our entrepreneurial energies. 5. Local Suppliers Ever since Northern and Midwestern manufacturers started shifting production to the lower-cost South and Southeast in the 1950s and 1960s, local agglomeration of suppliers has weakened. That process only accelerated in the 1970s through 1990s to places such as Southeast Asia, and to Mexico and China since then. To be sure, some global division of labor is required when labor-cost differentials are so high. But too much production dispersion hollows out productive supplier agglomerations, limiting innovation. A much weaker dollar would help this, as would instituting a border-adjustable value added tax (with the revenue being used to pay down the debt and reduce the business tax rate). An investment tax credit in new buildings and equipment would also help. Not since Henry Ford\u2019s River Rouge factory have companies been as vertically integrated. Now production systems are distributed with multiple tiers of suppliers. Speed requires close linkages with suppliers. When most suppliers are in close geographic proximity to an OEM, the process of sending requirements to suppliers (and learning from suppliers) and getting back new product is much faster. Most companies in the West have chosen globally distributed supply chains, in large part to cut costs by locating some or most of their production in lower-cost places. Since China is still largely a low-cost place, most of its suppliers are in China. In addition, because China specializes so much in manufacturing, and particularly in certain kinds of industries, it is able to enjoy rich production agglomerations. As noted, American companies have gone too far down the top-down route, letting less-profitable segments go, usually to Chinese competitors. America needs to rebuild a much deeper and robust supply chain, including in intermediate segments. 6. Investment, Subsidies, and Other Protections No legitimate economist would believe that, over time, a firm that is subsidized by the government could outcompete a firm that is not. And yet most economists turn a blind eye to Chinese subsidies, or even disparage China for being so dumb for misallocating capital. The stark reality is that the United States will not be able to be competitive in a range of advanced industries if the federal government does do not significantly boost industrial subsidies, via either direct spending or tax incentives. The short answer is we need vastly more real investment in the U.S. economy. Figure 24 compares private national investment in the United States and China. For decades, as a poor nation, China invested a lower share of its GDP in private investment. But by 2007, the lines crossed, and now China invests about 75 percent more than the United States does. Figure 24: Private sector gross fixed capital formation as a percent of GDP for United States and China [334] Congress took a step in that direction with the CHIPS Act and the IRA tax incentives for clean energy industries. It should be clear to any unbiased observer that absent the CHIPS Act, U.S. fab production would continue its long, steady decline. With the act, the United States has a real chance to significantly boost its global share of semiconductor production. But why only for semiconductors? While it is a critical industry, so are many others. While it is unlikely Congress can match the scale of Chinese industrial subsidies (including tax measures), Congress and the administration should set a goal to triple U.S. industrial subsidies annually. There has been some gradual recognition of this reality. Recently, Brad Seltzer argued that the federal government needs to provide \u201claunch aid\u201d subsidies for Boeing to bring to market at least two new airlines. [335] To those who say that we cannot afford it, there are plenty of revenue streams to pay for this, including a border-adjustable value-add tax, a carbon tax, or taxing dividends as normal income. Most policymakers support a strong national defense budget, not because they believe it generates economic returns (although defense spending does create technology spillovers), but because it keeps our nation strong and secure. It\u2019s time for more policymakers to view techno-economic investments in the same light: key investments to keep our nation powerful. The stark reality is that the United States will not be able to be competitive in a range of advanced industries if the federal government does not significantly boost industrial subsidies, via either direct spending or tax incentives. Moreover, if Congress took the China challenge truly seriously, it would have done something quite different and far bolder than the CHIPS and Science Act, as important as that was. Congress would have created a National Advanced Industry and Technology Agency dedicated to working closely with industry. [336] It would have appropriated far more money and required that most of the money be spent in university-industry research partnerships to support industries and technologies threatened by China. 7. Firm Size China knows that size matters. The CCP knows that only very large firms can marshal the capital needed for R&D investment, capital investment, and the overseas market expansion needed to better outlast foreign companies in battles of capital attrition\u2014the kind of battle Chinese firms enjoy the most. In contrast, the United States\u2019 approach to firm size and scale is undecided at best, and hostile at worst. From the emergence of the large corporation\u2014something the United States pioneered and which was the single most important factor in vaulting the United States to global leadership\u2014there have always been skeptics, arguing that either the benefit of bigness was not worth it or that there were few or no net benefits. Today, that view has devolved to outright anticapitalist antagonism toward large corporations, which the neo-Brandeisians see as their last big barrier to fundamental American transformation to a socialist economy. It's time for policymakers to call out the neo-Brandeisian movement for what it is: a radical, anti-American movement that will undercut our abilities to compete with China. In its place, we need an antitrust movement that moves beyond the consumer welfare principle to embrace the \u201cnational strength\u201d principle wherein all antitrust actions directed at firms in globally traded sectors will be evaluated on the principle of \u201cdoes this help or hurt America\u2019s ability to be a global leader in the particular industry involved?\u201d America used to do more of this, especially when we were competing with the Soviet Union. For example, in the 1950s when antitrust authorities went after their \u201cbig tech of the day,\u201d AT&T, Eisenhower\u2019s DOD Secretary \u201cEngine\u201d Charlie Wilson, the former CEO of GM, wrote the attorney general a letter expressing serious concern saying a breakup would destroy the company\u2019s \u201cusefulness for the future.\u201d [337] And the Department of Justice (DOJ) backed off. Once again in the 1980s when DOJ was at it again, DOD was opposed to breakup, with DOD Secretary Casper Weinberger coming out against it on national security grounds. In addition, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge argued that the suit was putting American leadership in telecommunications in jeopardy, as did a Reagan administration cabinet task force on telecommunications. [338] But this time, DOJ prevailed, and Bell Labs was all but decimated. Moving forward, Congress should strip FTC of antitrust authority and have DOJ be the sole arbiter. However, for all investigations involving companies in trade sector industries, DOJ should be required to get the public input of DOC and DOD. 8. Specialization As noted, China has built very specialized research institutes that concentrate talent and resources in one place. It\u2019s time for the United States to do the same. For example, Congress should fund NSF to create 30 to 50 ERCs that are 10 to 20 times larger than current centers. Current ERCs provide a maximum of $6 million per year . This is a pittance. We need a \u201cSUPER-ERC\u201d program that provides at least $60 million a year, with a requirement that industry match it with at least 15 percent of the funding. In addition, Congress should provide funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to create at least 5 to 10 national laboratories focused on key commercial technologies, modeled after what China, South Korea, and Taiwan have done. China is also supporting regional innovation hubs built around incredibly well funded advanced manufacturing institutes. Congress took one step in this direction with its passage of the Regional Innovation Hubs program (an ITIF proposal), but it remains massively underfunded and dispersed across government, with NSF, DOD, and DOC all having their own duplicative regional innovation hub programs. 9. Space America needs to return to its roots of permissionless innovation, where for the most part innovators could innovate and didn\u2019t need government approval to do so\u2014and in cases where government did intervene, the interventions were as light-touch as possible. With the rising antitechnology narratives that have taken over the United States, as spelled out in Technology Fears and Scapegoats: 40 Myths About Privacy, Jobs, AI and Today\u2019s Innovation Economy , that revival is likely to prove difficult. [339] But without it, it will be harder to effectively compete with China. EVs and the 10 S\u2019s With regard to the 10 S\u2019s ITIF has framed as part of its \u201cIs China Innovative?\u201d research series\u2014 S cience and engineering talent, a head S tart, S cale, S peed, local S uppliers, S ubsidies, S ize, S pecialization, S pace, and S trategy\u2014China\u2019s EV/EV batteries policy and strategy hit upon most of these. As noted, China earned a head start on developing EV technologies when it identified them in the mid-2000s as a leapfrog technology that could remediate its lag in internal combustion engine vehicles. China has achieved scale across multiple dimensions: As noted, it currently counts over 200 EV manufacturers, manufactures the most EVs, and has created the world\u2019s largest domestic market size for EVs. China\u2019s EV manufacturers prioritize aggressive development timelines (much faster than legacy carmakers) and speed to market, with multiple product iterations. This speed to market is enabled by a deep bench of local suppliers that can alacritously respond to requests for component adjustments. Similarly, especially for EV batteries, Chinese producers benefit from fully vertically integrated supply chains that reach all the way down to the raw materials and their processing. And China far and away leads the world in subsidies for its EV sector. Thus, the 10 S\u2019s provide a nice synthesis for how China is seeking to compete in EVs and EV batteries. 10. Strategy Emulating the best of Chinese policy means embracing an overarching goal\u2014at minimum, not losing the techno-economy lead to China\u2014and that means all areas of policy should be guided by this goal. If it sounds simple, that is because it is. The main reason the United States is losing ground vis-\u00e0-vis China on advanced industries and innovation is that this is not its overriding priority, the way countering the Soviet Union in the Cold War was. While the CCP puts technological advances front and center, this issue is virtually absent from our politics. [340] Where is the science and technology China agenda for either presidential candidate this year? It doesn\u2019t exist. Indeed, there is no real strategy in the United States other than perhaps to just get more innovation. To be sure, the United States now has a strategy to ensure chip production, but that is only for one industry. More often than not, the strategy appears to be to get less innovation through heavy-handed and aggressive regulation. If this is the approach Congress and the administration takes, it means that all major areas of policy need to be guided by the doctrine of national power capitalism, including education (a focus on STEM), trade (a focus on advanced industries, not all industries), antitrust (a focus supporting large firms that can compete with Chinese state-backed companies), tax (a business tax system that supports R&D, capital investment, worker training, and exports), finance policy (a Treasury policy that no longer defends the dollar), a science policy focused not on principal investigator discovery but on supporting the U.S. advanced industry capabilities, and regulatory policy (regulations designed in ways to enable speed and scale for key traded firms). This is perhaps the most important question: Double down on the current U.S. economic system or develop a new model of national power capitalism? In addition, while the discipline of science and technology policy is prominent in China, perhaps even more important than the discipline of economics, that is not the case in the United States. Science and technology policy is at best an insignificant sideline, with few in Washington focused on it\u2014and those that are consigned to the sidelines (e.g., the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy) not the center (e.g., the National Security Council, the Treasury Department). Moreover, it is almost completely ignored by the dominant economics and foreign policy disciplines, which know almost nothing about the discipline and practice of science and technology policy for competitiveness. [341] Perhaps one reason is that the United States became a global innovation leader without much of an explicit science and technology policy (unless one wants to classify defense spending on tech as one). But now that the United States is declining in science and technology relative to China, science and technology policy for competitiveness needs to be elevated to a much higher position. Vastly more needs to be done to educate local, state, and federal staff involved in economic policy in what science and technology policy for competitiveness is and how a government or set of governments should craft and implement effective science and technology strategy. Of course, many will argue that it is apostasy for the United States to emulate the Chinese model. As one study argues: The United States holds a lead in all the dynamically evolving fields examined in this study. The best way to sustain this leadership is to adopt a strategy that builds on America\u2019s asymmetric advantages, including our superior ability to operate and attract talent in an open global knowledge economy. Permitting the global technology system to bifurcate into hostile camps led by the United States and China would be self-defeating and impracticable. Engaging in a race to the bottom with China by emulating its statist and protectionist policies is a recipe for a weaker and less secure America. [342] Rather than admitting that there is anything to learn from China, the comfortable narrative is to double down on the distinctive U.S. model of commercial innovation. [343] Stay the course, but perhaps swim a bit faster. This is perhaps the most important question: Double down on the current U.S. system (which means support capitalism) or develop a new model of national power capitalism? How China Might Stall The 10-S aspects of the Chinese innovation system form a powerful engine for dominating globally advanced industries. But China\u2019s ultimate victory is not assured. There are a number of ways it could come up short. First, China\u2019s fiscal challenges may limit the government\u2019s ability to continue to subsidize its exporting industries to the extent it already has. This is especially true given the demographic challenges China faces. But it\u2019s important to note that China has significantly more fiscal policy headroom than many nations do because it is running huge trade surpluses and has greater ability to raise taxes and cut spending than do democratic nations. Second, China\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel is Schumpeterian innovation. This is what hurt Japan, at least in ICT industries, as it was not able to quickly adapt to what was first \u201cWintelism\u201d (Windows and Intel), and then the Internet and TCP-PI standards. However, unlike leaders in Japan, Chinese leaders are much more aware of the need for Schumpeterian innovation, which is why China is investing so much in next-generation leading-edge technologies. Third, efforts by the Western nations could significantly slow Chinese efforts, especially if they limit Chinese firm market access, fight more vigorously in third-country markets for market share, and cooperate on advanced technology development. But to date, while there are embryonic steps being taken, there is not much evidence that either America or its trading partners (especially the EU) are truly serious. Europe in particular continues to want to undercut allied nation interests by expanding business and investment in China while advancing the truly astounding claim that the United States and China are both equal competitors to the EU. [344] The reality is that without the EU waking up and seeing China as its principal threat and America as its ally, China will likely ultimately prevail. Moreover, it appears that the hope of export controls being the magic ingredient for restraining China is vastly overstated. A report by Georgetown\u2019s CSET highlights the relationship between export controls and innovation with a historical case study exploring past U.S. efforts to decouple its satellite technology supply chain from China. [345] Although export controls were able to delay China\u2019s advancement, today, the report notes, \u201cChina has caught up and even exceeded U.S. capabilities in some respects in spite of these restrictions on technology transfer.\u201d Similar concerns have been expressed about the recent expansion of export controls placed on advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment by the Biden administration. [346] Moreover, by definition, export controls reduce U.S. sales, thereby weakening U.S. firms in their ability to continue to innovate. Fourth, a military invasion of Taiwan, should such a catastrophic event occur, could potentially change things dramatically for China, leading more countries to start to restrict trade and other exchange with China. However, given that many nations continue to trade with Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, it\u2019s not clear if the global response would be much different. Europe, in particular, would likely issue some strongly worded declaration and even restrict trade and investment for a while, but they could very well return to business as usual at the conclusion of armed conflict, especially if China promised more European FDI. Fifth, once the Asian Tigers reached a certain level of technological capabilities, their original top-down industrial strategies gave way to more collaborative, industry-led strategies, more suited to their countries\u2019 new innovation system. It\u2019s not clear that the CCP will be able to show similar levels of flexibility, because in all the Asian Tigers\u2019 cases, democratic reforms accompanied and enabled industry policy reform. Sixth, a coalition of leading nations/regions in the West, including the United States, Japan, and the European Union, could collaborate to jointly develop technology advancement programs while putting in place policies to limit China\u2019s advantage, especially when it comes from unfair practices. While all these and other challenges are certainly possible, it would be folly for U.S. policymakers to put their head in the sand and hope for the best. Even if these Chinese challenges do emerge, the amount of damage that China and its firms could do to the U.S. economy in the interim is still massive. Moreover, if China follows the Japanese model of becoming a technology leader and then somewhat stalling out at a per capita income level of about 80 percent of U.S. levels, it would mean that Chinese GDP is three times greater than that of the United States, with more R&D spending, more global technology leaders, and probably five times more manufacturing. Not a pretty world for American or Western interests. How the United States Might Not Lose More Clearly, the relative position of the United Stats vis-\u00e0-vis China on innovation production will depend in part on what China does. But it mostly depends on what the United States does. There are at least three possible scenarios for that. First, our politics don\u2019t respond. The United States may continue to stumble along, never really making not losing to China a top priority. In this scenario, other issues\u2014climate change, income inequality, social justice, breaking up large businesses\u2014dominate American politics. On top of that, divided government precludes any real reform from happening. Should this happen, we should not delude ourselves. The results would be bleak in terms of America\u2019s ability to not lose further techno-economic ground to China. Indeed, many on the left view any efforts to compete with China as stimulating a new Cold War (bad) and spurring Asian racism. [347] The liberal Center for American Progress\u2019s main goal for competing with China is redistribution: \u201c Our policy should advance the interests of ordinary Americans by improving their opportunities, wages and working conditions.\u201d [348] And it goes on to argue that fighting climate change and racism are more important. In other words, the Left doesn\u2019t care. Related to continuing to stumble along, a traditional Republican Right would try to resurrect its old free-market tool kit, believing that lower taxes, reduced regulation, less public investment, and more free trade would do the trick. It would not do the trick of keeping America from losing. A Trumpian agenda would certainly put China economic competition more front and center. The problem is that it would likely not prioritize computer chips over potato chips. Tariffs on everything is not a strategy; it is a social policy. And there is little evidence that a Trump administration would pursue a China tech-focused tax or investment policy (e.g., a much higher R&D tax credit or much higher spending on R&D and advanced production). At the same time, we are likely to see core allies, such as Europe, continue to deepen their protectionism and anti-U.S. policies, making it more difficult to form a true alliance against Chinese techno-economic dominance. Second, if we are lucky, U.S. politics will embrace supporting capitalism and the policies that would entail. But doing so would mean significantly higher investments (e.g., tax and spending) in U.S. advanced technology capabilities, and given the massive U.S. national debt, this would have to be accompanied by tax increases (not on companies) and spending cuts. Let\u2019s be honest, neither are likely until U.S. finances are so dire that default is imminent. Third, another scenario is that, because of inherent U.S. strengths, the United States takes the lead and keeps it for at least a couple decades in an array of transformative technologies: new kinds of semiconductors, AI, quantum computing, and biotech. To be sure, such a scenario is possible, especially given the strength of the U.S. science and entrepreneurial ecosystem. But it would be harder than it might have been in the past because of Chinese capabilities. Finally, that leaves national power capitalism. Absent an invasion of Taiwan by China, the best hope for that is the U.S. national security establishment awakening from its stupor and raising the alarm of the structural weakness of the United States in advanced industries. While there have been some voices attempting to do that, by and large, the U.S. national security establishment has been quiescent. As troubling as it is to say, that suggests that only the invasion of Taiwan by China would be enough to shake America out of its stupor. After WWII, even though there were prescient voices warning U.S. leaders that the Soviet Union represented a generational threat to American interests and the free world, America largely let its military shrink. \u201cTime to come home\u201d was the view. It was only after the Soviet-backed invasion of South Korea that U.S. politics coalesced around significantly increased military and R&D spending. Indeed, inflation-adjusted federal R&D spending increased from $8.6 billion in 1950 to $55 billion in 1962. [349] But that was then, and this is now. Back then, the U.S. economy was growing much faster. Entitlement spending was limited. Tax rates were higher. The national ethos was to \u201cask not what your country can do for you.\u201d That is all different now. It\u2019s not clear if Americans have the stomach for another fight, and if our leaders have the courage and integrity to call for what it takes to win that fight. What To Do? It is beyond the scope of this report to lay out a full agenda to ensure that the United States, and for that matter its Western allies, does not lose its techno-economic lead to China. ITIF has laid out such a detailed agenda, including trade measures to protect U.S. and allied markets from unfair Chinese competition, in various reports. [350] However, this report does lay out five key proposals: 1. Triple the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. The Chinese R&D credit is already likely at least three times more generous than America\u2019s, its R&D labor costs are less than half, and its R&D personnel costs are likely at least half of costs in the United States. [351] One of the simplest and easy-to-administer steps Congress could take would be to triple the R&D tax credit for the Alternative Simplified Credit from 14 percent to 42 percent and allow expenditures on global standards setting to qualify. 2. Establish five national industrial research institutes focused on key, dual-use industries and technologies, modeled after Tawain\u2019s Industrial Technology Research Institute, an industry-government advanced technology lab focused largely on IT technologies, with a long track record of working on technologies in what is referred to as the \u201cmiddle Technology Readiness Levels\u201d beyond what universities work on and earlier than most companies work on. 3. Establish a \u201cCompetitiveness Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA\u2013C)\u201d to co-invest with industry on research and application of key technologies needed for dual-use national security leadership in the commercial sector. Funded by year five with at least $20 billion per year, such an entity could be administered by NIST. 4. Establish a national industrial development bank to provide low-interest patient capital for new domestic manufacturing investment. [352] 5. Institute a seven-year, 25 percent investment tax credit for all new machinery and capital equipment. America is \u201ccapital equipment lite\u201d; China is not. Conclusion Unless U.S. techno-economic policy changes to embrace \u201cnational power capitalism,\u201d it is less likely that the United States will be able to maintain competitive position in a broad array of advanced industries against not only China but also other nations that play more by the rules but are still competing for global market share. There are four main challenges to making this intellectual transition. First, the world has never been confronted with a model such as China\u2019s: a massive country dead set on practicing power trade to win in advanced industries. Too many American policymakers, experts, and pundits simply refuse to believe what is right before their eyes. Second, the lion\u2019s share of policy experts focused on China come from a national security or foreign policy background, not a techno-economic one. As such, the narrative and agenda are colored by these concerns. Case in point, the dominant argument for limiting Chinese imports is almost always about security, not preserving U.S. techno-economic capabilities. Third, the strong commitment still by many to free-market capitalism, coupled with the emerging commitment to worker and climate capitalism, is likely to drown out voices and forces advocating for national power capitalism. Vastly more pundits, experts, and policymakers see climate change and reducing inequality\u2014not China\u2014as the existential challenges of the day. Moreover, even those who recognize a China threat, default to \u201cdoubling down\u201d on support capitalism and the American system. We need to understand that this system has failed to address the China challenge. It is time to accept the reality that we need to construct a new national innovation system. The lion\u2019s share of policy experts focused on China come from a national security or foreign policy background, not a techno-economic one. Their concerns color the narrative and agenda. Finally, America has never been able to be on a \u201cwar\u201d footing unless war came to America first (e.g., the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, WWI and WWII, and the Cold War with the Soviet Union fought in a series of proxy hot wars [e.g., South Korea, and Vietnam]). But each time war came, America responded with overwhelming productive force. But this time is different. At least in the last century, America never faced an adversary that could outproduce it. Now it does. Unfortunately, the odds are that America will not be able to get on techno-economic war footing absent a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. This is problematic because the results of this study suggest that China has for the most part not caught up to the world\u2019s innovation leaders, but that it is making extremely rapid strides and, absent some kind of external or internal shocks, is likely to be at or very close to the global innovation frontier in most advanced industries in the next 10 to 20 years. There are several implications for this, and the outcome depends in large part on Western nations\u2019 responses. Scenario One: China as Innovation Leader One outcome, what we term \u201cChina as the Center,\u201d sees a decline in global market share of technology value added in the leading Western nations, with China becoming dominant. The United States would still have some innovative companies, just as the United Kingdom, for example, has companies such as Rolls Royce and Glaxo Smith Kline. But many U.S. companies would have been forced into bankruptcy; others purchased by Chinese firms; and still others downsized and moved to less intensely competitive parts of the market (e.g., services). The odds of this scenario increase if the current U.S. political economy of anticorporate and antitech animus, fiscal crisis, and political polarization continue. Such a geographic shift in the center of global innovation production is not unprecedented. In fact, that has been the nature of industrial transformations since the first industrial revolution the United Kingdom led starting in the 1790s. As the second transformation starting in the 1840s involving exiles, rail, and hand-crafted metal works emerged, the center of gravity became less diffuse, with parts of Western Europe and America becoming active players. With the third transformation starting in the 1890s and powered by steel, precision machine tools, electricity, and the internal combustion engine, the United Kingdom was displaced, with Germany and the United States becoming the leaders. With the fourth wave of innovation starting in the late 1940s, and powered by electronics, chemicals, and mass production of consumer goods, the United States cemented its lead, with Germany weakened by the war and the Soviet Union constrained by communist central planning. It was only by the end of this period in the late 1970s and early 1980s that followers began to catch up, including Germany and Japan. With the fifth transformation starting in the late 1980s and powered by information technology, including computing and software, the United States still led, although the center of gravity for U.S. innovation shifted from the East Coast and Midwest to the West Coast. As we enter into the sixth wave of innovation, powered it appears by AI, autonomous systems, and materials innovation, it seems likely that China will gain the mantle of the world\u2019s innovation center. Within a few decades, we could be in a world where it is China that is imposing export controls on the United States. It is impossible to overstate the implications of this potential development, as it would entail a massive switch in the center of global economic power and innovation from a geopoint somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean to somewhere in China. To be sure, just as the United Kingdom still has some tech capabilities and firms after its half century of industrial decline, the West will not become, as Alexander Hamilton warned, a complete hewer of wood and drawer of water, dependent on the innovation leader of the time, the United Kingdom. But if China can move to the frontier of global innovation\u2014a destination all forces in China are pulling toward\u2014the world economy and relative national power will be fundamentally transformed. If China gains significant capabilities, the limits of U.S., or even allied, export controls will significantly decline. Export controls work when one side has something the other side does not. When both are at parity, they are ineffective. Who knows? Within a few decades, we could be in a world where it is China that is imposing export controls on the United States. Scenario Two: Strategic Parity Here China succeeds in a number of industries, such as robotics, chemicals, EVs, nuclear power, and consumer electronics\u2014putting major competitive pressures on Western firms in these industries\u2014but it cannot achieve innovation parity in more engineering or scientifically complex sectors such as biotech, aerospace, software, or semiconductors. This scenario is more likely if the Western nations, and the United States in particular, are able to overcome their significant political economy challenges and put in place world-class national innovation systems, including with significantly more funding for industrial technology development. This would require the United States to move from a science-based innovation system\u2014with the view that scientific research is the foundation of national innovation success\u2014to an industrial-production-capabilities view that sees utilizing knowledge in products and service at scale as the key. Scenario Three: Japanification In this scenario, like the Japan challenge of the 1980s and early 1990s, China loses steam and its companies fail to make the needed transitions to new technology systems. This is certainly possible, but its probability is greater if the United States can accelerate the speed of innovation in a variety of technologies, including semiconductors, biotechnology, AI, and others, while slowing China down, including by joint action to increase the value of the yuan and limiting Chinese exports. Regardless of which scenario plays out, the best strategy from the U.S. and other Western nation perspective is to embrace national power capitalism designed to maintain the lead over China on most advanced technology industries.

K. Wellington Koo , was a Chinese diplomat, politician, and statesman of the Republic of China . Born in Shanghai , Koo studied at Columbia University in the United States, where he obtained a PhD in international law and diplomacy. On his return to China in 1912, he became Yuan Shikai 's secretary for foreign affairs, and in 1919, was a member of China's delegation at the Paris Peace Conference , where he unsuccessfully demanded the return of Shandong . Between 1922 and 1927, Koo successively served the Beiyang government as minister of foreign affairs, minister of finance, acting premier, and president. After the Northern Expedition toppled the government in 1928, Koo joined the Nationalist government and continued his diplomatic career. In 1931, he represented China at the League of Nations to protest the Japanese invasion of Manchuria . He served as China's ambassador to France and Great Britain during World War II , and in 1945 represented China at the signing of the Charter of the United Nations . From 1946 to 1956, he served as the Republic of China's ambassador to the United States, and sat as a judge on the International Court of Justice in The Hague from 1957 to 1967. He retired in New York City and died at the age of 97. Early life and education [ edit ] Born in Jiading , now a suburb of Shanghai, in 1888, Koo grew up in an upper-class cosmopolitan family and was fluent in both English and French, which greatly aided his diplomatic career. [ 1 ] In 1895, he was greatly affected by China's defeat at the hands of Japan in the First Sino-Japanese War , which led to the humiliating Treaty of Shimonoseki . [ 2 ] Koo later wrote: \"Ever since I was seven years old, when I heard with depressed heart the news of China's defeat by Japan, I had desired to work for China's recovery and the removal of the Japanese menace\". [ 2 ] Koo's father resolved to give him a \"modern\" education to help him prepare for the coming 20th century and to work for China's modernization. [ 2 ] The naval battles during the recent war where the modern British-built warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy had blown out of the water the antiquated junks of the Imperial Chinese Navy had dramatically shown that modern, industrial powers had the advantage over backward nations. [ 2 ] In 1897, Germany occupied the Shangdong Province after a short campaign, which again showed to the young Koo that as long as China was backward, it would be bullied by stronger powers. [ 3 ] Aged 11, Koo was sent to be educated at the Anglo-Chinese Junior College in Shanghai, where he was taught in English various subjects such as modern science and geography, though his studies were cut short when he contracted typhoid fever . [ 3 ] While at the college, Koo once rode a bicycle down the streets of Shanghai into the International Settlement and followed an English boy also riding a bicycle onto the sidewalk, where an Indian policeman allowed the English boy to continue while stopping Koo to give him a fine for riding his bicycle on the sidewalk. [ 3 ] Koo was shocked to discover that owing to extraterritoriality, the laws and rules that applied to Chinese in China did not apply to British subjects\u2014in this instance, laws prohibiting riding a bicycle on the sidewalk\u2014and that a foreign policeman had power over the Chinese police. [ 3 ] Koo was left with a lifelong desire to end the status of extraterritoriality that had been imposed by the 19th-century \"unequal treaties\". [ 3 ] Koo in 1912 Koo studied at Saint John's University, Shanghai from 1901 to 1904, [ 4 ] and Columbia University in New York City , [ 5 ] : 49 where he was a member of the Philolexian Society , a literary and debating club, editor-in-chief of the Columbia Daily Spectator , and graduated with a B.A. in liberal arts (1908) and a M.A. in political science (1909). In 1912, he received his Ph.D. in international law and diplomacy from Columbia. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Early diplomatic career [ edit ] Koo returned to Beijing in 1912. He served the Republic of China as English Secretary to President Yuan Shikai . In 1915, Koo was made China's Minister to the United States and Cuba. The Paris Peace Conference [ edit ] In 1919, he was a member of the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference , led by Foreign Minister Lu Zhengxiang . In 1897, China had been forced to sign a treaty that gave a 99-year lease giving sovereignty over the city of Qingdao to Germany while also giving Germany various special rights and economic control over the Shandong peninsula. Qingdao became the principal German naval base in Asia. In 1914, Japan entered World War I on the Allied side and seized Qingdao after a siege. The Japanese made it very clear that they wished to take over the German rights in Shandong province by right of conquest, a demand that the Chinese vehemently rejected. [ 8 ] In January 1915, Japan presented the 21 Demands that if accepted would have turned China into a virtual Japanese protectorate, warning in a note presented to the Chinese that Japan would take \"vigorous methods\" if the 21 Demands were rejected. [ 9 ] Following protests from the United States that the 21 Demands would negate the Open Door policy towards trade with China, the Japanese dropped the more extreme of the 21 Demands. [ 10 ] On 25 May 1915, the Japanese forced the Chinese to agree that after the war ended, the Japanese would take over all of the German rights in the Shandong peninsula, which caused protests all over China over what was deemed \"National Humiliation Day\". [ 10 ] As a young diplomat, Koo was strongly opposed to the acceptance of the Japanese demands. Koo had become close to President Woodrow Wilson , who invited him to visit the White House, where he was given to understand that the United States would support China's demands regarding the Shandong peninsula against Japan at the Paris Peace Conference. [ 11 ] Wilson asked for Koo to attend the peace conference in Paris, and moreover, Koo travelled on the same ship that took Wilson and the rest of the American delegation to France in December 1918. [ 11 ] The Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan wrote: \"Koo, who was only thirty-two in 1919, was a forceful and distinguished personality...At Columbia University, in New York, where he earned an undergraduate and graduate degree, he had been an outstanding student...He had also been on the university debating team, as the Japanese delegates would learn to their cost\". [ 11 ] The Chinese delegation stayed at the Hotel Lut\u00e9tia, though the Australian journalist George Ernest Morrison who also served with the Chinese delegation stayed at the MacMahon Palais. [ 12 ] On 22 January 1919, Alfred Sao-ke Sze of the Chinese delegation arranged for a dinner attended by Koo where Ronald Macleay of the British delegation frankly told that Britain \"could not do much\" in the matter of the Shandong. [ 13 ] During the First World War, hundreds of thousands of Chinese coolies went to France where they dug the trenches for both the British and French armies, often under German fire. [ 13 ] Koo argued very forcefully that though no Chinese troops had fought in Europe, the sacrifices of the Chinese coolies who dug the trenches amid appalling conditions on the Western Front entitled China to be treated as one of the powers that made an important contribution to the Allied victory. [ 13 ] When Macleay suggested that Britain would probably favor the Japanese claims on the Shandong Peninsula because Japan had done more for the Allied victory than China, Koo countered him with saying that besides for expelling the Germans from the Shandong in 1914 that Japan had done nothing for the Allied cause while Chinese coolies had dug the trenches from the fall of 1914 onward until the end of the war in 1918. [ 13 ] Before the Western powers and Japan, he demanded that Japan return Shandong to China. On 27 January 1919, the peace conference turned towards Asia. [ 14 ] Makino Nobuaki of the Japanese delegation tried to lump in Shandong with the Marshall Islands, Carolina islands and the Mariana Islands, which the Allies had already agreed would go to Japan. [ 14 ] However, it was decided to sever Shandong from the Pacific islands. [ 14 ] The next day, Lu disappeared and Koo took charge of the Chinese delegation. [ 14 ] At the Quai d'Orsay, Makino gave a speech making Japan's case for the Shandong that made a poor impression owing to his haltering delivery with Wilson commenting afterwards that it had been \"painful\" to listen to Makino's speech. [ 14 ] 1920 Autochrome by Auguste L\u00e9on On the morning of 29 January 1919, Koo gave a rebuttal speech in English that MacMillan described as \"...a dazzling speech replete with learned references to international law and Latin tags\". [ 14 ] Koo argued that under international law that treaties signed under threats of violence were invalid, and as such the Sino-Japanese treaty of 25 May 1915 was invalid as China had signed under duress as Japan was threatening war if its terms were not met. [ 14 ] He further stated that the original Sino-German treaty of 1897 was also invalid as Germany was threatening war unless the Reich was granted special rights in the Shandong. Koo stated that all the people of China were grateful to the Japanese for ending the harsh German rule over the Shandong in 1914, but noted: \"But grateful as they are, the Chinese delegation felt that they would be false in their duty to China and to the world if they did not object to paying their debts of gratitude by selling the birthright of their countrymen and thereby sowing the seeds of discord in the future\". [ 15 ] Koo noted that under Wilson's 14 Points, the basis of the peace was to be national self-determination, which led him to argue that Japan had no right to the Shandong as its people were overwhelmingly Han and wanted to be part of China. [ 16 ] Koo stated that the Shandong \"was the cradle of Chinese civilization, the birthplace of Confucius and Mencius and a Holy Land for the Chinese\". [ 16 ] The French Premier Georges Clemenceau praised Koo for his eloquent speech. [ 16 ] The American secretary of state, Robert Lansing , wrote that Koo had crushed the Japanese with his speech. [ 16 ] The Canadian prime minister, Sir Robert Borden , called Koo's speech \"very able\". [ 16 ] Clemenceau described Koo as \"a young Chinese cat, Parisian of speech and dress, absorbed in the pleasures of patting and pawing the mouse, even if it was reserved for the Japanese\". [ 11 ] Through mostly at odds with the Japanese delegation, Koo supported and voted for the Japanese-sponsored Racial Equality Proposal . [ 17 ] On 12 April 1919, the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George bluntly asked Koo: \"Which would China prefer-to allow Japan to succeed to the German rights in Shandong as stated in the treaty between China and Germany or to recognize Japan's position in Shandong as stipulated in the treaties between China and Japan?\" [ 18 ] Koo replied in English: \"Both alternatives are unacceptable\". [ 18 ] Koo seized upon the 14 Points, which stated that secret treaties were invalid, to argue that the secret treaties in 1917 under which Great Britain, France and Italy all agreed to support Japan taking over the German rights in the Shandong peninsula, were invalid. [ 19 ] Koo was greatly hurt when Lloyd George casually told him that China had made only the most \"minimal\" contributions to the Allied cause as he dismissed the work of the Chinese coolies in digging the trenches on the Western Front as unimportant. [ 20 ] Lloyd George finally dismissed Koo's concerns about the 21 Demands under the grounds that he never heard of the 21 Demands. [ 21 ] On 22 April 1919, in what Koo always saw as a betrayal, Wilson\u2014whom he had invested such hopes in\u2014came out in support of Japanese claims on the Shandong as he stated that \"the war had been fought largely for the purpose of showing that treaties cannot be violated\" and it was \"better to live up to a bad treaty than tear it up\" as he argued that China was bound by the 1915 treaty. [ 21 ] Koo's forceful advocacy of the Chinese case made him internationally famous while his status as a widower whose wife had just died of the \" Spanish flu \" conveniently ensured that he was free to marry again. [ 22 ] The Oei family, a wealthy huaren (ethnic Chinese) family from the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), had decided that Koo should marry Oei Hui-lan . [ 22 ] During the last months of the Paris peace conference, Koo was often seen with Oei at dinners and social receptions. [ 23 ] Koo's romance with Oei, whom he showered with flowers and gifts, distracted from his work at the conference. [ 23 ] Oei complained in her memoirs that Koo spent his days pursuing her instead of engaging in his \"important work as the second Chinese delegate\". [ 23 ] On 4 May 1919, it was decided that the former German rights in the Shandong province would go to Japan, sparking the May Fourth Movement in China as hundreds of thousands of Chinese university students demonstrated against the decision. Koo found himself bombarded with telegrams from Chinese university students asking him not to sign the Treaty of Versailles if it meant ceding the Shandong, at one point receiving 7,000 such telegrams in a single day. [ 24 ] Koo also called for an end to imperialist institutions such as extraterritoriality, tariff controls, legation guards, and lease holds. The Western powers refused his claims and, consequently, the Chinese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference was the only nation that did not sign the Treaty of Versailles at the signing ceremony. Initially, Koo had planned to sign the Treaty of Versailles as long he could insert reservations stating his government was opposed to the Japanese gaining the German rights in the Shandong. [ 25 ] Clemenceau however told Koo that this procedure was unacceptable and that the Chinese could either sign the Treaty of Versailles or not sign. [ 25 ] Koo was keen to have China be one of the founding members of the League of Nations, which would signify its desire to be treated as an equal by the other nations of the world. [ 26 ] The possibility of not signing the Treaty of Versailles and being excluded from the League were major concerns for him, [ 26 ] which led him to discover a loophole in the Treaty of St. Germain , which also included the Covenant of the League of Nations in its first section. [ 26 ] In this way, Koo could avoid signing the Treaty of Versailles whilst he signed the Treaty of St. Germain, which made China automatically a member of the League of Nations. [ 26 ] Koo and Oei remained in Paris after the conference ended, and at an especially sumptuous ball attended by the elite of Paris society announced in French their engagement on 10 October 1919. [ 27 ] By this time, many had assumed that Koo was already married to Oei as the fact that Koo's first wife had died in January of that year was not well known. [ 27 ] Political career [ edit ] Koo in the 1920s Koo also was involved in the formation of the League of Nations as China's first representative to the newly formed League. In 1921, Koo became the Chinese minister to Britain. Much to his displeasure, Punch published a ballad that \"welcomed\" Koo to London that read: \"'Morality, heavenly link'/I'm sure you will never taboo,/Through to it, I don't think you'll 'eternally drink'/Temperate Wellington Koo/It is rather malicious, I own/To play with a name that is true/But I hope you'll condone my irreverent tone/Generous Wellington Koo\". [ 28 ] The implication of the ballad that Koo was a not a diplomat representing China who was worthy of respect, but rather just a foreigner with a \"funny\" name who existed to amuse the British greatly offended him. To make up for the slight, King George V invited Koo and his glamorous young wife, Hui-lan Oei, as the guests of honor at a reception at Buckingham Palace for the visiting King Albert I of Belgium . [ 28 ] At the reception, the fluently English-speaking and youngish couple made a great impression on the high society of London. [ 28 ] In October 1921, Koo was reassigned as the Chinese minister in Washington. [ 28 ] Koo was to represent China at the Washington Naval Conference , hence his sudden reassignment to Washington just after his arrival in London. [ 29 ] Koo's principal opponent at the Washington conference was Kij\u016br\u014d Shidehara , the Japanese ambassador in Washington. [ 29 ] The Washington conference proved to be Koo's triumph as the conference ended with Japan renouncing its claims to the Shandong and the attending powers all signing the Nine-Power Treaty affirming the independence of China. [ 30 ] After the conference, Koo returned to China a national hero. [ 30 ] From 1922, Koo served successively as Foreign Minister and Finance Minister. On 15 May 1924, he was the target of assassination attempt when an ornate gift package arrived at his house addressed to him, which Koo's servants opened instead. [ 31 ] Upon opening the package, a bomb exploded, killing one of the servants while another two were badly wounded by the blast. [ 31 ] The man who sent the package fled to Japan, which led Koo to conclude that the Japanese were behind the attempt on his life. [ 31 ] Later that month, Koo signed a treaty with the Soviet Union under which the Soviet Union renounced all \"Unequal treaties\" that China had signed with Imperial Russia in exchange for which Koo recognized the de facto independence of Outer Mongolia, which until then he had claimed as part of China. [ 31 ] Koo opened up talks with the British for the return of the British colony of Weihaiwei , which the British had signed a 25-year lease on in 1898, which led Koo to argue as 1923 had already passed, the lease had expired. [ 32 ] There was much spirited disagreements as the British were unwilling to consider returning the colony, despite the fact the 25-year lease had expired in 1923. [ 33 ] The talks were broken off when the warlord General Feng Yuxiang , aka \"the Christian General\" seized Beijing, forcing Koo to flee for his life. [ 33 ] Much to Koo's own humiliation, he was forced to take refuge in Weihaiwei. [ 33 ] The British authorities in Weihaiwei refused Feng's demand to hand over Koo to his men, who would almost certainly had executed him. [ 33 ] Feng's rule over Beijing did not last long as the capital was soon taken by the army of another warlord, Marshal Zhang Zuolin , the \"Old Marshal\" of Manchuria. [ 33 ] With Beijing in the hands of Zhang, Koo returned to the city. [ 34 ] Koo disliked Zhang, an illiterate bandit turned warlord who professed to be fighting to restore the \"Great Qing Empire\", but was willing to work with him as Zhang favored diplomacy to revise the \"Unequal treaties\" instead of war, a choice of options that coincided with Koo's own preferences. [ 32 ] Zhang had a reputation as one of China's most brutal warlords, but his inability to read and write led him to crave the approval of intellectuals. Zhang appointed Koo as his premier and foreign minister, hoping this would add luster to his regime and would lead to foreign governments recognizing his government. [ 32 ] Ominously, for Zhang, the British refused to recognize his government and dropped hints that they favored the rival government based in Guangzhou led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. [ 32 ] He was twice Acting Premier, in 1924 and again in 1926 during a period of chaos in Beijing under Zhang Zuolin in 1926\u20137. Koo was Acting Premier from 1 October 1926 and acted concurrently as Interim President. (On March 12, 1925, Sun Yat-sen died in Wellington Koo's home in Beijing, where he had been taken when it was discovered he had incurable liver cancer.) [ 35 ] As Foreign Minister, he often clashed with Sir Miles Lampson , the British minister-plenipotentiary in Beijing over his demands that China have the right to control its own tariffs and the end of British extraterritoriality, demands that Lampson vehemently rejected. [ 36 ] Lampson had essentially Victorian views of China and his relations with Koo were stormy. [ 36 ] Lampson reported to London that after one meeting that he had \"harangued Koo till I had exhausted my vocabulary\". [ 36 ] He served as Premier from January until June 1927, when he resigned after Zhang organized a military government. After the Northern Expedition toppled the government in Beijing in 1928, he was briefly wanted for arrest by the new Nationalist government in Nanjing, but through Zhang Xueliang 's mediation he was reconciled with the new government and returned to the diplomatic service. He represented China at the League of Nations to protest the Japanese invasion of Manchuria . Much to Koo's fury, the British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon, was able to insist the League not take action against Japan, and instead appoint a commission to examine whether Japan had committed aggression or not. Koo was assigned to the League's Lytton Commission -so called after its chairman, Lord Lytton -that was sent in December 1931 to go to Manchuria to investigate if Japan was an aggressor or not. [ 37 ] Ambassador in Paris [ edit ] Koo in 1936 In August 1932, Koo arrived in Paris as the Chinese minister-plenipotentiary. [ 38 ] Koo also concurrently served as the chief of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations when it was holding its sessions in Geneva. [ 38 ] When Lord Lytton finally presented his report to the League in February 1933 concluding that Japan had indeed committed aggression, it was the subject of much debate within the League. In March 1933, Koo gave what was described as a very strong speech, urging the League to finally act against Japan, now that it was established by the Lytton commission that Japan had committed aggression. [ 39 ] The Japanese delegate to the League, Y\u014dsuke Matsuoka , promptly announced that his government did not accept the Lytton report and was leaving the League, effective immediately. During the Abyssinia Crisis caused by the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, Koo was a strong supporter of having the League of Nations apply sanctions against Italy, believing this was a hopeful precedent that might led to the nations that belonged to the League supporting China should Japan invade. [ 40 ] In May 1936, the Italians took the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa and Benito Mussolini proclaimed victory in Rome. Though the Italians never fully controlled the Ethiopian countryside, the conquest of Ethiopia was a major blow to the prestige of the League of Nations. Koo wrote at the time that at the League's headquarters in Geneva there was \"a general sickening atmosphere at the impotence and cowardice\" of the League in face of the Italian aggression against Ethiopia. [ 40 ] On a more hopeful note for Koo, he met the Soviet foreign commissar Maxim Litvinov who often attended the sessions of the League and discussed with him the possibility of Soviet aid to China. [ 41 ] In 1936, France and China upgraded their relations from the legation to embassy level, and Koo thus became the first Chinese ambassador to France. Fluent in French, Koo and his wife tried very hard to join the high society of Paris, believing it was the best way to make China's case to the French elite. [ 42 ] At one party, a French society hostess who believed him to the Japanese ambassador told him: \"Japan is a big power, becoming more powerful by the day. You will surely be able to shallow up China\". [ 42 ] Koo was forced to tell her that he was actually the Chinese ambassador and the last thing he wanted to see was his country being \"shallowed up\" by Japan. Likewise, Madame Koo tried to leave a party by asking her hosts to call for her chauffeur and her limousine, only for the Japanese ambassador's limousine and chauffeur to appear, as her hosts did not know the difference between Japanese and Chinese. [ 42 ] Koo's two teenage sons embarrassed him by throwing deck chairs in a lake in a Paris park, and tried to claim diplomatic immunity when a French gendarme ordered them to stop. [ 42 ] The incident attracted much adverse comment in the French newspapers about the badly behaving sons of the Chinese ambassador who were trying to abuse diplomatic immunity. The Chinese diplomats in Europe together with their families formed a closely knit group who frequently met to discuss matters of common concern. [ 43 ] Koo together with Guo Taiqi (the ambassador in London), Tsiang Tingfu (the ambassador in Moscow), Tsien T'ai (the minister-plenipotentiary in Brussels) and Liang Long (the minister-plenipotentiary in Prague) formed an informal group of intellectuals-turned-diplomats who had similar values and beliefs. [ 44 ] The Chinese diplomats stationed in Europe were all intellectuals who given up promising careers in academia to pursue careers in diplomacy in order to best serve China. [ 45 ] Cheng Tien-fong , the ambassador in Berlin, was considered to be the \"weakest link\" amongst the Chinese diplomats with the feeling being that he was unqualified to be a diplomat. [ 44 ] Second Sino-Japanese war [ edit ] Koo c. late 1930s In July 1937, Japan invaded China. On 7 July 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred, and the Japanese promptly sent 5 divisions into northern China that advanced on Beijing. [ 46 ] Koo spent many sleepless nights in the summer of 1937 as he worried deeply about the crisis. [ 46 ] Koo met several times with diplomats from the Japanese embassy in Paris in an attempt to find a diplomatic solution, but the Japanese kept making extreme demands that Koo rejected. Koo wrote in his diary that the news from China was \"depressing\" as he expressed dismay at the news that the Japanese had taken Beijing, adding in \"I felt no face to see anybody. China has become a joke\". [ 46 ] Koo broke off talks with the Japanese who had rejected his demand that Beijing be returned to China. [ 46 ] Koo wrote in his diary that reports that the Japanese were heavily bombing Tianjin \"made his hair stand up\" with fear. [ 47 ] Later that same month, the Japanese took Tianjin, which Koo called his diary the \"most depressing and sickening news\". [ 46 ] As China had hardly an arms industry at the time and needed to import arms, the Chinese were at a disadvantage against the better armed Japanese, whose more industrialized nation did have an arms industry. Koo's principal duty in Paris was to secure the supply of arms into China via a railroad that ran from the French colony of Indochina (modern Vietnam) into China. [ 48 ] The arms that were carried into China were not just French, but also came from the Soviet Union. [ 48 ] Several times, the French cabinet considered closing the railroad following complaints from the Japanese embassy in Paris and dark hints that Japan might invade Indochina if the railroad were not closed, but Koo was always able to persuade the French to keep the railroad running. [ 48 ] Koo felt that the best response to the Japanese invasion was a Sino-Soviet alliance with \"Anglo-American-French material co-operation in the background\". [ 49 ] Koo believed that as the victors of World War I that both Britain and France had a vested interest in upholding the international order created after that war with \"the moral sympathy and support of the United States\". [ 50 ] Koo argued that the Franco-Soviet alliance provided for a certain stability in Europe, and the lack of the same stability in Asia was what explained why \"Japan could run amuck\". [ 51 ] Koo felt it was in their own interests of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States to support China, and he was gravely disappointed when he discovered that his viewpoint was not as widely shared as he had assumed. [ 51 ] As the chief of the Chinese delegation, Koo went to Geneva to lodge a formal complaint at the League of Nations, arguing that Japan was guilty of aggression and the League should impose sanctions on Japan, just as it had imposed sanctions on Italy for its aggression against Ethiopia in 1935. [ 51 ] Koo did not expect the League to take action, and the failure of the League to save Ethiopia was hardly an auspicious precedent. However, Koo thought an appeal to the League might win public sympathy in the West. At a meeting with the French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos , Koo learned that the French \"advised delay\". [ 52 ] Koo in turn told Delbos: \"The aggression of Japan against China was too flagrant, and if the League should refuse to take cognizance of it, the League would become a complete farce\". [ 52 ] Delbos cynically told Koo that the League was useless and that \"You might as well call for the moon for help as much as the League of Nations\". [ 52 ] In September 1937, Koo gave a speech to the League, asking for Japan to be declared the aggressor. [ 52 ] Koo reported to Nanjing that it was clear that \"the League could not do much\" and that \"the matter hinged with Britain and France\", the two veto-holding members of the League Council. [ 52 ] Both the British and French delegations advised Koo not to ask for sanctions against Japan, warning that the United States was not a member of the League and that sanctions against Japan would only work if the Americans also applied sanctions. [ 52 ] Koo himself thought that calling for sanctions would be a mistake as American \"collaboration\" with imposing sanctions was essential, but the Waichiaopu insisted that Koo ask for sanctions against Japan. [ 52 ] Koo was urged to take his case to the League's Far Eastern Advisory Committee instead of the League Assembly, advice he was predisposed to accept. [ 53 ] Koo wrote it \"was useless to force things if the powers were unwilling\" and it was better to \"work with them instead of against them\". [ 53 ] The Waichiaopu rejected his advice and ordered him to make a case for sanctions. On 16 September 1937, Koo gave a speech at the League's Far Eastern Advisory Committee, asking for the League to declare Japan the aggressor, impose wide-ranging sanctions to cripple the Japanese economy and provide China with economic support. [ 53 ] In his appeal, Koo listed a number of war crimes committed by the Japanese, being careful to only quote from reports from Europeans and Americans in order to avoid accusations of bias. [ 54 ] Speaking with great anger, Koo stated: \"In Tianjin, the most crowded parts of the Chinese city were bombed by Japanese aeroplanes, killing hundreds of people for no other reason than to terrorize civilians. The sight of mangled bodies and the cries of the maimed and wounded were so sickening to the hearts of the foreign Red Cross doctors that they voiced the fervent wish that the governments of the civilized Powers would make an effort to stop the carnage\". [ 54 ] As Koo had predicted, both Britain and France used their veto powers to prevent Japan from being declared the aggressor. [ 53 ] In his speech, Koo declared that every day the Japanese were indiscriminately bombing Chinese cities, killing hundreds of innocent people and declared: \"Public opinion everyway in the world was indignant, and expected the League to do something\". [ 53 ] All that Koo achieved was a resolution from the League criticizing the Japanese policy of indiscriminate bombing of Chinese cities, and instead asked for the Japanese to engage in discriminate bombing of Chinese military targets. [ 53 ] On 1 October 1937, at a meeting of the Far Eastern Advisory Committee, the British delegate to the League, C.A. Edmond, announced that his government wanted to see a Nine-Power conference to be held in Brussels about seeking a diplomatic solution to the Sino-Japanese war. [ 53 ] Koo wrote the British offer \"fell like a bomb, deafening the senses\". [ 53 ] In an attempt to involve the United States, the British resolution called all the powers that signed the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 (which included the United States) to attend a conference in Brussels to discuss a solution to the war. [ 53 ] On 5 October 1937, the Far Eastern Advisory Committee submitted to the League Assembly a resolution criticizing the Sino-Japanese war in general without saying which power was responsible, and merely asked that all of the League members not to take any steps that might weaken China's ability to resist. [ 53 ] Koo was dissatisfied with the attempt to shift the onus on action from the League to the signatory powers of the Nine-Power Treaty, saying that: \"the Washington Treaty cannot relieve League members of their obligations under the Covenant\". [ 55 ] Koo was chosen to head the Chinese delegation to the Brussels conference, which took place in November 1937. [ 55 ] Koo believed that American involvement in the Brussels conference signaled a determination on the part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to take action, saying he believed that \"the United States...would not like to see the conference fail and admit defeat\". [ 56 ] However, Koo's hopes were dashed by a meeting with William Christian Bullitt Jr. , the American ambassador to France, who was a close friend of President Roosevelt. Koo was warned that the United States was unwilling to take a leadership role at the conference and would prefer that Koo not attend to provide \"full liberty of discussion\". [ 56 ] Before departing, Koo told Delbos: \"China did not want peace at any price, but only peace with justice\". [ 56 ] In the meantime, the Japanese had threatened to bomb French Indochina if the French continued to allow arms to be imported into China. [ 57 ] On 17 October 1937, Koo was informed that France would continue to allow arms to be sold to China, but none could be taken in via the Indochinese railroad, which in effect cut China off from French arms. [ 57 ] In response to vehement criticism from Koo, the French reversed their position and agreed to reopen the railroad, albeit on a \"temporary\" basis. [ 57 ] On 31 October 1937, Koo left Paris for Brussels, and his train took him through a number of battlefields of World War One. [ 56 ] Koo later wrote that as he watched from his train the still recovering French countryside that it \"led me to reflect that although the youthfulness of the trees and the relative newness of the buildings still told the story of the war, the world had learned little from it. A new war was in the atmosphere everywhere\". [ 56 ] On November 3, 1937, the conference opened and Koo gave a speech accusing Japan of aggression. [ 58 ] Japan was invited to attend the conference, but the Japanese chose to boycott it instead. [ 58 ] Norman Davis , the head of the American delegation, took the viewpoint that it was up to Britain and France to confront Japan and that the United States would only do the barest minimum possible to restrain Japan. [ 58 ] Koo who had expected more of the Americans was deeply discouraged. The French were only prepared to act if the United States was willing to take the lead as the French saw Franco-American co-operation in Asia as a way of bringing the United States into European affairs to restrain Germany. [ 58 ] The British likewise would only act in Asia if the United States were willing to take the lead. [ 58 ] On 12 November 1937, Japan issued a statement firmly ruling out taking part in the Brussels conference and refused the offer of mediation, claiming that the war was a defensive struggle as the Japanese maintained that China was the aggressor. [ 58 ] After the conference, Koo met with the American and British delegations, saying that all he wanted was for the United States and the United Kingdom to ship arms on a massive scale to China while offering up a \"guarantee\" to protect French Indochina from a Japanese attack. [ 59 ] Koo argued that: \"just as domestic order requires more than laws on the statute books, mere words are insufficient to restore peace and order in the face of international violence\". [ 59 ] At a press conference, Koo stated that at the conference Britain had acted like a \"friend\" towards China while the United States had not, a remark that infuriated Davis. [ 59 ] However, Koo continued to invest his hopes in the United States, writing \"that the United States could save the situation if it only act quickly and energetically\". [ 59 ] In December 1937, Koo's spirits sank to a new low by the news that the Japanese had taken Nanjing, the capital of China, which was promptly followed up by the infamous Nanjing Massacre . [ 48 ] That same month, the Japanese sank the American gunboat U.S.S. Panay on the Yangtze river and in the process killed several American sailors. [ 48 ] Koo hoped that the Panay incident might lead to the United States taking action against Japan, and he was disappointed when Roosevelt chose instead to accept the Japanese apology that the sinking of the Panay was a mistake, despite the fact the Panay was flying the US flag at the time the Japanese aircraft bombed the gunboat. [ 48 ] Koo noted in his reports that the French were worried that keeping the Indochinese railroad open would lead to a Japanese invasion of Indochina. [ 48 ] Koo countered this thesis by arguing that if the Japanese conquered China, it would be likely that they would try to conquer Indochina, and it was in France's own interest to assist China. Despite their fears, the Indochinese railroad remained open. [ 48 ] Europe in the late 1930s [ edit ] During the Sudetenland crisis of 1938, Koo favored having the idea of deterring Germany from invading Czechoslovakia by involving the League of Nations, whose charter called for \"collective security\" in the event of aggression. [ 51 ] Koo believed that this represented a precedent that could be applied to China. [ 60 ] The French cabinet minister that Koo was most close to was Georges Mandel , the minister of the colonies. [ 61 ] As the colonial minister, Mandel was in charge of French Indochina and thus had the power to allow or deny arm shipments to China. By contrast, Koo had difficult relations with Georges Bonnet , the foreign minister who was in favor of ceasing arm shipments to China to improve relations with Japan. [ 61 ] Through Mandel did not always the authority, he continued to allow Soviet arms to be transshipped via Indochina to China over the protests of both Bonnet and the Japanese. [ 61 ] Koo reported that through the French Premier \u00c9douard Daladier did not always support the anti-appeasement faction in his cabinet led by Mandel, but that Daladier was sympathetic towards China and overruled Bonnet when he pressed to have the Indochinese railroad closed. [ 62 ] French premiers in the Third Republic had powers analogous to the chairmen of a committee as cabinets in the Third Republic were coalition governments. The Daladier cabinet was divided into three factions with the \"peace lobby\" (appeasement) faction led by Bonnet; the \"firmness\" (anti-appeasement) faction led by Mandel; and Daladier leading another faction that rested uneasily between the other two. The ambassador that Koo spoke with the most was William Christian Bullitt Jr. , the American ambassador to France. [ 63 ] Bullitt was a close friend of President Franklin D. Roosevelt who had appointed him ambassador to France in 1936 to serve as his personal representative in Paris as Bullitt completely by-passed the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, and instead sent his reports straight to the president, whom he also spoke to by telephone at least once every week. Koo had hopes that speaking to Bullitt would influence Roosevelt. [ 63 ] In July 1938 when the Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau Jr. , visited Paris, Bullitt introduced him to Koo, whom spoke about the need for American economic aid to China. [ 63 ] Through Morgenthau could make no promises on behalf of Congress, he promised to use his influence in Washington to lobby for financial aid to China. [ 63 ] In September 1938, Koo attended the fall session of the League of Nations in Geneva, where he pressed for sanctions against Japan. [ 60 ] In his speech, Koo complained at the previous sessions of the League in September 1938 and in May 1938, all China had received were \"nicely-worded resolutions\", going on to say \"The resolutions remain nothing, but empty words.\" [ 52 ] Citing the Sudetenland crisis, both the British and French delegations asked for Koo not to speak about the Sino-Japanese war, saying this was not an opportune time to speak of the issue, but Koo ignored their objections. [ 52 ] After the Munich Agreement, Koo reported to Chongqing that Germany was now the dominant power in eastern Europe, which he felt had important ramifications for China. [ 64 ] Koo wrote that the result of the Sudetenland crisis had badly damaged the prestige of France, which led him to predicate that the French would become more preoccupied with European affairs at the expense of Asian affairs. [ 64 ] Koo wrote that the way that Czechoslovakia\u2014a major French ally since 1924\u2014had been forced to accept a highly unfavorable settlement in the form of the Munich Agreement, had left France's other allies in eastern Europe such as Poland, Yugoslavia and Romania \"fearful\" of the future. [ 64 ] Koo predicated that the French would either accept eastern Europe as being in the German sphere of influence or make an attempt to retain influence in eastern Europe by strengthening their existing alliances, arguing that the latter was the more likely of the two scenarios. Koo described the British prime minister Neville Chamberlain as an \"old man\" who ignored \"obligations under international law or the principle of international morality\" during the crisis. [ 64 ] Koo wrote that Chamberlain wanted to revive the 19th century Concert of Europe by creating an Anglo-German duumvirate that would \"dominate and control the smaller and weaker powers\". [ 64 ] Koo argued that Chamberlain's attempts to create an Anglo-German dominated new Concert of Europe had finished off the League of Nations as a force in world politics and would have a disastrous impact on Anglo-Soviet relations, which had never been friendly to begin with. [ 64 ] Finally, Koo concluded that Joseph Stalin was angry at the way that the Soviet Union had been snubbed during the Sudetenland crisis, which he argued would focus Soviet attention on Europe at the expense of Asia. [ 64 ] He felt that the possibility of an Anglo-German new Concert of Europe would greatly strain Anglo-Soviet relations. Koo stated that he believed that the Soviet Union would never a risk a war with Japan as long as Germany continued to expand into Eastern Europe and would hence limit the amount of aid it would provide China to avoid a war with Japan, through he also predicated that the Soviets would not cut off aid to China as they preferred to keep the Japanese engaged in the war. [ 64 ] On 3 November 1938, the Japanese Prime Minister, Prince Fumimaro Konoe , called a press conference in Tokyo where he proclaimed the \"New Order in Asia\" as he made a statement to the effect that Japan was now the hegemonic power in Asia and that China was in the Japanese sphere of influence. [ 53 ] The American, British and French governments all issued statements rejecting the Japanese claim to the \"New Order in Asia\", which encouraged Koo. [ 53 ] Koo was especially encouraged by the American statement, which he felt reflected \"a hardening of the American attitude vis-\u00e1-vis Japan\". [ 53 ] Koo noted that the French were still permitting military supplies to be sent to China through French Indochina, and his thesis that helping China was a way of helping France by keeping the Japanese engaged was winning him friends in Paris. [ 53 ] On 15 March 1939, Germany occupied the Czech part of Czecho-Slovakia, creating the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia . In response, a new Anglo-French policy of creating a \"peace front\" to deter Germany from further aggression was inaugurated. [ 55 ] During the Danzig crisis , Koo supported the policy of the \"peace front\", believing that it would benefit China by preventing a war in Europe that would benefit Japan by distracting Anglo-French attention away from Asia. [ 55 ] Koo tried to associate China with the \"peace front\", arguing that supporting China would benefit both Britain and France by keeping the Japanese engaged in China, which in turn would limit the possibility of the Japanese attacking the British and French colonies in Asia. [ 55 ] Koo described Japan as a nation bent \"on the conquest of China, subjection of Asia and finally domination of the world\". [ 55 ] Somewhat paradoxically, Koo found himself defending the \"unequal treaties\" that he was normally opposed to as he argued to French leaders that the Japanese conquest of China would \"make it impossible to safeguard legitimate western rights and interests, and that respect for China's sovereignty and maintenance of the open door\". [ 55 ] In June 1939, Koo discovered a senior Chinese diplomat, Huang Zheng, had been selling visas to Jewish refugees from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia. [ 65 ] Koo recorded the incident: \"Apparently an agreement was signed between a travel agency and the visa office of the consulate-general to secure Chinese government passports for Jews who had fled by the hundreds, if not the thousands, from the Fascist- and Nazi-dominated parts of Europe...and the applicants were charged 800 francs upon receiving a visa, which was well above the regular fee, and, as was reported to me, the money was divided between one certain travel agency, through which only the Jewish applicants could get the passports from the consulate-general annex, and the Chinese consulate-general. It was evidently an illicit, unauthorized and unjustifiable attempt by the issuing group to exploit the situation of the Jews\". [ 65 ] Huang was suspended and the Waichiaopu told Koo that the visas were invalid. [ 65 ] The leaders of several French Jewish groups met with Koo to ask him to lobby the Waichiaopu to allow the Jewish refugees to travel with the visas, arguing that though Huang was corrupt, that the refugees had purchased the visas in good faith to escape Europe. [ 65 ] Koo did press the Waichiaopu to allow the Jewish refugees to go to China. On 22 June 1939, Koo stated he read reports in the French press of a plan to settle Jewish refugees in Yunnan province, leading him to ask his superiors what was the Chinese attitude towards accepting Jewish refugees. [ 66 ] Koo also noted the refugees wanted to settle in Shanghai, which was the largest and wealthiest city in China, and which had been occupied by the Japanese in November 1937. [ 66 ] Koo argued it was not clear if the Japanese would actually allow the Jews to settle in Shanghai, but that allowing Jewish refugees to travel to Shanghai with visas issued by the Republic of China was an important symbolic gesture that the Republic was still the legitimate government of all China. [ 66 ] War in Europe [ edit ] On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and on 3 of September, Britain and France declared war on Germany. Koo wrote in his diary on 3 September 1939: \"These are momentous days in history, the beginning of a war which may alter the face of the world and of civilization itself\". [ 58 ] Shortly afterwards, Koo suggested in a message to Chiang Kai-shek that China formally declared its wish to align with the Allied powers and to offer Chinese resources and manpower to aid the Allied cause in Europe. [ 67 ] On 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland, leading to calls to expel the Soviet Union from the League of Nations. [ 68 ] At the session of the League Assembly when a vote was taken to expel the Soviet Union, Koo as the chief of the Chinese delegation chose to abstain from the vote, which ended with the Soviet Union become the first and only member to be expelled from the League. [ 68 ] On 18 June 1940, the Japanese submitted an ultimatum threatening to invade Indochina if the French did not end all arms sales to China at once. [ 57 ] On 20 June 1940, the government of Philippe P\u00e9tain submitted to the ultimatum and ended all arms sales to China. [ 57 ] On 21 June 1940, an armistice was signed, taking France out of the war. Koo briefly served as the Chinese ambassador in Vichy, where he was forced to live under reduced conditions. [ 69 ] Under the armistice signed on 21 June 1940, Germany imposed harsh reparations on France while the franc was artificially devalued in regard to the Reichsmark , which essentially allowed the occupiers to loot France. Owing to the shortage of food in occupied France, Koo's wife observed that he was forced to eat canned food for the first time in his entire life. [ 69 ] Koo spent the rest of the summer of 1940, trying to persuade Vichy officials to resume arms shipments. [ 70 ] Koo reported to Chongqing that France was \"powerless\" in Asia as he stated that he had information on good authority that the Germans had ordered that the French should not \"provoke\" the Japanese. [ 70 ] In July 1940, the British submitted to a Japanese ultimatum and closed the Burma Road, though the road was reopened again in October 1940. [ 70 ] In September 1940, the Japanese occupied the northern half of French Indochina. [ 70 ] For Koo, the only hopeful news that the United States reacted sharply to the Japanese advance into Indochina, warning Tokyo that this was regarded in Washington as an extremely unfriendly act, and that the Japanese should not occupy the southern half of French Indochina under any conditions. Ambassador in London [ edit ] Koo in 1945 In 1941, Koo was appointed Chinese ambassador in London. [ 71 ] He remained the Chinese ambassador to the Court of St James's until 1946. Koo decided that wartime London was too dangerous for his family to live, and sent his wife and children to New York. [ 72 ] Madame Koo had wanted to go to London and went to New York most unwillingly. [ 72 ] Many in the Foreign Office disliked Koo as one of Britain's \"bitterest enemies\" in the 1920s, charging that he was a Chinese nationalist who rejected the \"white man's burden\" view of Britain's role in the world. [ 71 ] Koo's main role in London was in seeking British support for China and especially to ensure that the British did not close the Burma Road, which was China's lifeline following the closure of the French railroad to China. [ 73 ] In July 1941, the Japanese occupied the southern half of French Indochina, giving Japan the ability to project air and naval power well into the South China Sea. [ 74 ] In response, the American, British and Dutch governments imposed an oil embargo on Japan and froze all Japanese assets in their countries. [ 74 ] The Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden chose not to inform Koo of these steps, who first learned of these British moves from reading the newspapers. [ 74 ] Koo was deeply worried about a possible Japanese invasion of Burma, which would close the Burma Road. [ 74 ] Koo pressed for more British aid to China, only to be told that the British were fully committed to the struggle against Germany and had little to spare to assist China. [ 74 ] In the summer and fall of 1941, Koo offered to have Chinese troops sent to reinforce the garrison in Hong Kong, only to be politely rebuffed as the Foreign Office told him that the existing Anglo-Indian-Canadian garrison could hold Hong Kong against any Japanese attack. [ 75 ] Following the Japanese attack on the British empire in December 1941, the Japanese invaded the British colony of Burma in January 1942 from Thailand. As an ambassador in London, Koo played a critical role in the talks that saw the British grant the Chinese permission to send two armies into Burma to assist the British in the defense of Burma. [ 76 ] The British prime minister, Winston Churchill , was opposed to accepting the Chinese offer, preferring that Burma be defended by only British troops or Indian troops under the command of British officers. [ 76 ] Much to Koo's pleasure, the dire situation in Burma with the British being defeated by an invading Japanese force that consisted of only 2 divisions forced Churchill to accept the Chinese offer of help. [ 76 ] For Koo, the fact that Britain was being forced to accept Chinese help symbolized how the Second World War was changing the face of world politics. However, the Chinese intervention did not stem the Japanese advance and by May 1942 the Japanese had occupied all of Burma, reaching the frontiers of India. Koo noted that the Japanese victories in southeast Asia were further cutting off China from the rest of the world, but at least had the benefit of making British officials more respectful as he noted after the fall of Singapore, the British lost their customary disdain for Asians. [ 76 ] The way that only four divisions of the Imperial Japanese Army who despite being outnumbered three to one by an Anglo-Indian-Australian force opposing them had been able to conquer Malaya and Singapore, billed at the time as the \"Gibraltar of the East\", in less than two months both astonished and shocked British officials. Koo noted that though Churchill was firmly committed to the \"Europe First\" strategy that the Japanese victories in southeast Asia that had pushed the Imperial Japanese Army right to the frontiers of India increased the importance of keeping China in the war. [ 76 ] From 1937 to 1945, 38 of the 51 divisions of the Imperial Japanese Army were fighting in China with only 9 divisions being used for the conquest of southeast Asia in late 1941 and early 1942. In December 1941, the Japanese sent 1 division to conquer the British colony of Hong Kong; 4 divisions to conquer the British colonies of Malaya and Singapore; another 2 divisions to conquer the American colony of the Philippines; another 3 divisions to conquer the Dutch colony of the Netherlands East Indies (modern Indonesia); and finally assigned 2 divisions to the conquest of the British colony of Burma. [ 77 ] The Special Landing Force of the Imperial Japanese Navy was assigned the task of taking Wake island and Guam. [ 78 ] From the British perspective, it was crucial that the Chinese continued to fight the Japanese, which improved the Chinese bargaining position in London. [ 76 ] Koo noted that paradoxically the Allied defeats in 1941\u20131942 had improved China's bargaining position as both the British and the Americans very much wanted to keep the Chinese fighting in order to keep the 38 Japanese divisions in China from being used against their forces. [ 76 ] Koo also pressed hard to end the 19th century \"unequal treaties\" and especially wanted the end of British extraterritorial rights in China. [ 79 ] On 11 January 1943, Koo signed in London a new Sino-British treaty that saw Britain renounce all of its extraterritorial rights in China, through the British refused to return Hong Kong as the Chinese had wanted. [ 80 ] Through Koo failed to secure the return of Hong Kong, he called the new Sino-British treaty in his diary \"a really an epoch-making event\u2014the biggest treaty in a century\". [ 80 ] In 1943, Madame Koo and her children finally arrived in London, but this time a rift had developed in the marriage as Koo was most unhappy with the ghost-written autobiography that his wife had just published prior to leaving New York. [ 72 ] In 1943, Chiang Kai-shek visited India, where he caused a storm in the British press by his statements in favor of Indian independence, saying he wanted to see India \"free now and independent after the war\". [ 81 ] However, Chiang also voiced support for India continuing in the war as he warned that the Japanese were not liberators, and stated he envisioned a free India as an ally of China against Japan, which Chiang called a brutally imperialistic power. [ 81 ] Chiang ordered Koo to provide him with an assessment of British public opinion regarding India. [ 81 ] Chiang also instructed Koo that his answers to the British protests regarding his statements were to state that China wanted India to be granted Dominion status, which he believed would lead to the Indians of their own choice continuing the war. [ 81 ] Koo reported that on the basis of statements made in the House of Commons and in the British press that only a minority in Britain favored independence for India with the majority favoring continuing the rule of the Raj after the war. [ 81 ] Koo followed his orders by stating to British officials that China only wanted to see India to become a Dominion, and was shocked to hear various British officials insist that to give India Dominion status would lead to \"twenty years of anarchy and disorder\". [ 81 ] When Koo asked why the Indians could not be trusted to govern themselves, he was told that \"occidental influence had only penetrated the top strata of Indian society\". [ 81 ] The Foreign Office officials told Koo that they thought that China was suffering from a \"persecution complex\". [ 81 ] Koo met Churchill at 10 Downing street, where he found the prime minister to be \"a little peeved and sullen\". [ 81 ] Churchill told Koo that \"the British were not decadent and defeatist\" as was being said in the Chinese newspapers, and then returned to a genial mood. [ 81 ] In late July 1943, the Chinese Foreign Minister, T. V. Soong , visited London, where he met with Eden and Koo to discuss plans for a British offensive from India into Burma with the aim of reopening the Burma Road. [ 82 ] Soong reported to Chiang that based on his talks with Eden and Koo that the British did not regard China as a serious military power and that Churchill was far interested in the war against Germany than with Japan. [ 82 ] Soong's assumptions were proved correct when he met with Churchill on 4 August 1943. [ 82 ] Churchill listed a number of ways to defeat Japan such as a strategical bombing offensive, having the Soviet Union declare war on Japan, invading Japan via the Aleutian islands, and an offensive by the Chinese, but notably did not mention any offensive into Burma. [ 82 ] After the Cairo conference of 1943, Eden told Koo that he rather liked Chiang and his American-educated wife, Soong Mei-ling , who served as his translator as Chiang only spoke Mandarin. [ 83 ] Koo reported to Chongqing that Eden was the only member of the British cabinet who was sympathetic towards China, and expressed regret that Eden was not the prime minister, writing that Anglo-Chinese relations would be much better if Eden instead of Churchill were the prime minister. [ 83 ] Wang Shih-chieh, a member of Chiang's staff, told Koo after the Cairo conference that Chiang and Churchill disliked each other, and Roosevelt was forced to play the peace-maker. [ 84 ] Eden told Koo that Churchill had tried to explain British grand strategy to Chiang as he maintained that the British were committed to defeating Japan, but had to devote most of their resources towards the war against Germany as the British were fighting in Italy and were due to take part in an invasion of France the next year. [ 85 ] Most notably, Churchill had changed his position, agreeing that the Anglo-Indian-African 14th Army would launch an offensive into Burma in 1944, but Chiang continued to mistrust him, believing that Churchill was not being sincere. [ 85 ] Unlike Chiang, who had a deep mistrust of Britain, Koo favored an Anglo-Chinese alliance after the war, preferably with the United States also joining. [ 86 ] During a visit to China in 1943, Koo told Chiang that Churchill was strongly anti-communist and did not expect the wartime alliance with Soviet Union to continue after the war. [ 86 ] Koo stated he felt with the long-standing vexatious issue of extraterritorial rights finally settled in China's favor, it would be possible to make an alliance with the United Kingdom against the Soviet Union after the war. [ 87 ] Chiang was opposed to Koo's ideas, believing that such an alliance would limit his ability to deal with the Soviets by committing China to a rigidly anti-Soviet line, and would only agree to such an alliance if the United States also joined in, which he thought was unlikely. [ 87 ] Chiang expected the United States to return to isolationism after the war, just as it had done after the First World War. [ 87 ] Chiang told Koo that \"English diplomacy\" was \"shrewd and cunning\" and that British would \"adhere stubbornly to their traditional polices\". [ 87 ] In the summer of 1944, Koo was contacted by agents of Charles de Gaulle, who wanted an agreement that China would support restoration of French rule in Indochina after the war. [ 88 ] Koo advised Chiang to accept the French offer, stating that France would probably become a major power again after the war. [ 88 ] At the United Nations [ edit ] Koo (second from left) in Washington, DC, as Ambassador to the United States, 1953 In 1945, Koo was one of the founding delegates of the United Nations, and the first signer\u2014the \" John Hancock \"\u2014of the United Nations Charter. He later became the Chinese Ambassador to the United States and focused on maintaining the alliance between the Republic of China and the United States as the Kuomintang began losing to the Communists and had to retreat to Taiwan. [ 89 ] Koo retired from the Chinese diplomatic service in 1956. [ 90 ] and in the same year he became a judge of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, [ 91 ] and served as vice-president of the Court during the final three years of his term. In 1967, he retired and moved to New York City, where he lived until his death in 1985. [ 6 ] In an interview conducted in 1969 on the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles, Koo stated that the Paris peace conference, which launched the May 4th movement, was a turning point in Chinese views of the West as he observed that many Chinese intellectuals believed the victorious powers of 1918 would allow China to be treated as an equal, and the outcome of the Paris peace conference had turned public opinion against the Western powers. [ 92 ] There was a widespread feeling in China that given the suffering of the Chinese coolies on the Western Front that France, Great Britain and the United States would reward China for its sacrifices. Koo stated: \"Looking back at China's stand at the Paris peace conference and the developments preceding, it appears that these events are...a turning point in China's history, both from the domestic and international point of view...One could wonder what would be the situation in China [today] either if China had succeeded in settling the Shandong question in Paris to her satisfaction or if she had signed the treaty without the reservation. These are questions which probably can never be fully answered now\". [ 92 ] Koo noted that the new Communist government in Russia, which denounced liberalism as a device for Western imperialism and renounced all of the special Russian rights in China gained under the Tsarist regime, won tremendous prestige in China as the one power that seemed willing to treat China as an equal, which led directly to the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in 1920. [ 93 ] Personal life [ edit ] Madame Wellington Koo (n\u00e9e Hui-lan Oei) in 1922 with son Yu-chang Wellington Koo Jr.; photographed by Henry Walter Barnett In 1908, Koo married his first wife, Chang Jun-o ( traditional Chinese : \u5f35\u6f64\u5a25 ; simplified Chinese : \u5f20\u6da6\u5a25 ; pinyin : Zh\u0101ng R\u00f9n'\u00e9 ). They divorced in 1912. [ 94 ] Koo's second wife, Tang Pao-yueh \"May\" ( \u5510\u5bf6\u73a5 ; \u5510\u5b9d\u73a5 ; T\u00e1ng B\u01ceoyu\u00e8 ; c. 1895\u20131918), was one of the illegitimate daughters of the former Chinese prime minister Tang Shaoyi and a concubine Mai-Mai Sze . [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] Their marriage took place soon after Koo's return to China and divorced his first wife in 1912. She died in the U.S. during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. [ 98 ] They had two children: a son, Teh-chang Koo (1916\u20131998), [ 99 ] and a daughter, Patricia Tsien (1918\u20132015). [ 100 ] Koo's third wife was the socialite and style icon Oei Hui-lan (1889\u20131992). [ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] She married Koo in Brussels , Belgium , in 1921. [ 104 ] [ 102 ] She was previously married, in 1909, to British consular agent Beauchamp Stoker, by whom she had one son, Lionel, before divorcing in 1920. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Much admired for her adaptations of traditional Manchu fashion, which she wore with lace trousers and jade necklaces, [ 104 ] Oei Hui-lan was the favorite daughter of Peranakan tycoon Majoor Oei Tiong Ham , and the heiress of a prominent family of the Cabang Atas or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia. [ 108 ] She wrote two memoirs: Hui-Lan Koo (Mrs. Wellington Koo): An Autobiography (written with Mary Van Rensselaer Thayer, Dial Press, 1943) [ 109 ] [ 110 ] and No Feast Lasts Forever (written with Isabella Taves, Quadrangle/The New York Times, 1975). [ 111 ] Koo had two sons with her: Yu-chang Wellington Koo Jr. (1922\u20131975) and Fu-chang Freeman Koo (1923\u20131977). [ 112 ] [ 113 ] On September 3, 1959, Koo married his fourth wife Yen Yu-yun (1905\u20132017), [ 114 ] the widow of Clarence Kuangson Young, who had been his long-term mistress since the 1930s while her husband was still alive. [ 115 ] [ 116 ] He had three stepdaughters from this marriage: Genevieve (wife of American photographer and film director Gordon Parks ), Shirley , and Frances Loretta Young (wife of Oscar Tang ). [ 98 ] [ 117 ] Death and legacy [ edit ] Though he outlived two of his sons, Koo died surrounded by his family on the night of 14 November 1985, aged 97. Wellington Koo was survived by his fourth wife, two children, nineteen grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. [ 118 ] Dying older than the 87-year-old Qianlong Emperor , the 87-year-old Republic of China President Chiang Kai-shek , the 92-year-old People's Republic paramount leader Deng Xiaoping , and the 96-year-old People's Republic paramount leader Jiang Zemin , Koo holds the distinction of being the longest-lived person to ever lead China. Despite this, both his third and fourth wives lived even longer than he did\u2014 Oei Hui-lan died at the age 103 and Juliana Koo died aged 111.
